# Evidence Integration

## Mohammed's Implementation

The process of finding the final entity and relation that is best suited for the query being imposed on the system.

They generate all tuple combinations and each being scored by the product of their component scores. 

If no relation exists for an entity (it is obviously removed)

If any ties are shown, the most "popular" entity (number of edges incoming the node) Node Centrality?
