......................................................................................", "86 vi 1 1.", "INTRODUCTION Mr Speaker, We are now at the start of a new term of office following last June\u2019s election when the people of Malta and Gozo have once again confirmed their trust in the present Government with a greater majority than that of March 2013.", "As with every start of a new legislature, it is important to look at the starting point for this Government.", "I assure you Mr Speaker, that this start point is that much better than that of 2013.", "From a financial perspective, we managed to turn a deficit of \u20ac300 million in 2012 to a surplus of over \u20ac100 million in 2016 and according to the latest data for the first eight months of the current financial year; another surplus will be registered in 2017.", "Today there are 5,000 less unemployed persons than in 2013.", "Today we have around 22,000 more gainfully occupied persons.", "We have around 11,000 more women in employment than what we had at the beginning of the last legislature.", "2 In 2017, we have 28,000 more people working in the private sector than we had in 2012.", "This reflects the robust economic growth achieved by the present Government.", "Today, the number of individuals on social benefits, including single parents, is approximately 3,000 less than in March 2013.", "The number of persons on unemployment benefits is approximately 3,500 less than what we found at the beginning of our first term of office.", "These results were achieved because of reforms in the benefit system including the \u2018tapering of benefits\u2019 and the \u2018in-work benefit\u2019 both of which provided pathways for social benefits claimants to enter the labour market.", "In 2017, the Maltese economy has continued to show consistent progress.", "In the first 100 days of this term in office, we managed to achieve - A credit rating upgrade for our economy from Fitch Ratings from A Stable to A Positive.", "- DBRS credit rating agency changed the economic outlook from A Stable to A Positive.", "3 - S&P credit rating agency changed our economic outlook from Stable to Positive.", "In addition, all this came just one year after they had upgraded our economy from BBB+ to A- .", "In the first 100 days of this legislature, Malta was rated to have had the best economic growth within the European Union and to have had the best increase in the creation of jobs within the EU.", "Furthermore, we have also seen major reductions in poverty.", "Latest statistics show that the number of people at risk of poverty decreased by 9,000.", "We have also managed to drastically reduce the number of people who are unable to make ends meet, from 17.0 per cent in 2012 to 6.6 per cent in 2016.", "All this was made possible because of a succession of budgets, which were well planned fiscally, economically and socially so that the wealth that was created was also being equally distributed.", "We achieved much of what was promised in the electoral manifesto in a thoughtful, well-\n planned, prudent and consistent manner.", "Mr Speaker our economic successes have also generated new challenges.", "The biggest challenge is that of investing and strengthening of our infrastructure to keep the pace with the high rate of economic growth.", "4 Private and public investment in infrastructure, which includes roads and other transport facilities, increasing the housing stock, the generation of energy from waste and waste management, will complement and enhance the continued economic development of our islands.", "Mr Speaker, I assure you that we shall be achieving these objectives during this term of office.", "Thanks to the sensible decisions of our Prime Minister Joseph Muscat in the last four years, we are now in a position to focus on what is best for the future of our country.", "This will be the first budget of this term in office where we will start to address the challenges that will take us into the future.", "1.1.", "The economic and financial context Mr Speaker, during 2016 the Maltese economy grew by 5.5 per cent in real terms, while in the first six months of this year, it grew by 6.3 per cent.", "This is much higher than the average economic rate of growth of 2.2 per cent being registered by other EU Member States.", "During the first half of this year, private consumption grew by 4.4 per cent.", "In annualised terms, this reflects an increase of \u20ac246 million in wages and salaries and \u20ac468 million in business profits.", "5 Economic growth continued to be diversified with all sectors, including manufacturing, registering increases in Gross Value Added.", "The labour market continued to be robust.", "In fact, in 2016 we registered a growth of 3.3 per cent in employment while the unemployment rate fell to 4.7 per cent.", "In the second quarter of this year, total employment increased by 2.5 per cent over the same period of last year, while female employment increased by 3.1 per cent.", "This resulted in a decrease in the unemployment rate to 4.1 per cent with unemployment for young people falling to 10.6 per cent.", "The number of persons registering for work went down to less than 2,500 in August 2017.", "The private sector continued to be the major contributor to the increases in employment.", "In fact in March of this year, the total increase in employment reached 9,512, where over 8,500 of these were employed by the private sector.", "This represents 90 per cent of the increase.", "It is important to note that although we had a rapid increase in employment and a record decrease in unemployment, the rate of inflation remain subdued.", "The annual rate of inflation in 2016 was that 6 of 1.0 per cent according to the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) and of 1.06 per cent according to the Retail Price Index (RPI).", "In August of this year, the annual rate of inflation remained relatively low at 1.2 per cent (HICP) and of 1.17 per cent (RPI).", "We have seen improvements in our external trade balance, where Malta\u2019s current account registered a surplus of 6.6 per cent in 2016.", "In the second quarter of this year, this surplus increased even further to a record surplus of 16.6 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).", "This substantial surplus confirmed the increases in the exports of products and services that amounted to 3.5 per cent for the year 2016.", "These increases were strengthened during the first half of this year with increases in exports of goods and services of 2.6 per cent when compared to the same period last year.", "Record increases were also registered in the tourism sector.", "During 2016 the number of tourists that visited our islands reached the 2 million mark while in the first 8 months of this year, Malta has already has already recorded the one million and a half tourists.", "This translates into an increase of 17.3 per cent, which in turn translates into \u20ac1.3 billion tourist expenditure.", "7 Malta has increased its\u2019 competitiveness which is reflected in the last edition of the GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS INDEX (2017-2018) of the World Economic Forum.", "Malta has advanced by three places so that from a list of 138 countries, Malta now ranks in the 37th place.", "Mr Speaker, I now would like to move on and discuss in more detail the condition of our country\u2019s public finances.", "(See tables 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3).", "Today, our country is longer in excess deficit procedure but rather and I am very proud to say that we have ended the year 2016 with a surplus of over 1 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product, which translates into a surplus of over a \u20ac100 million, a first in the last 35 years.", "If we take a close look at the fiscal situation and the consolidated fund for the first eight months of 2017, it should be noted that the Government has succeeded in registering a surplus of \u20ac31 million.", "This means an improvement of \u20ac110 million when compared to the same period in 2016.", "We have succeeded in securing these positive results in the public finances because we have worked prudently keeping our expenditure under control while increasing our revenues so that the additional increases in public spending would always be lower than the increases in revenue.", "8 Mr Speaker, all this indicates that by the end of this year we shall be registering a surplus in our fiscal balance for the second consecutive year.", "Let us now have a look at the national debt.", "In the year 2012, the national debt, when compared to our GDP, was nearing 70 per cent.", "Our main objective on taking office in Mach 2013 was to reduce the national debt to 60 per cent of GDP.", "Despite the fact that we called an election a year earlier than the five-\n year legislature term, not only did we reach our target and reduce the national debt, but we also reduced it even further such that the debt-to-\n GDP ratio declined to 57.6 per cent.", "All this happened in a very consistent way such that it strengthened our credibility with the EU and beyond, including the International Monetary Fund and other international credit rating agencies.", "1.2.", "The economic and fiscal projections Before I move on to our economic and financial projections, I would like to give a brief overview of the international scenario.", "Latest projections show that the global economy is expected to grow in the coming years, as developing and emerging countries are expected to gain momentum.", "9 The International Monetary Fund calculates that global growth will reach 3.6 per cent in 2018.", "Advanced economies are expected to keep growing in moderation.", "While the United States of America is expected to grow by 2.1 per cent, emerging and developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate of 4.8 per cent.", "In the meantime, the European Commission is predicting a growth of 1.8 per cent in real terms for both the EU and the Euro Zone.", "Our country\u2019s projections compare well with the global context, the European Union and the Euro Zone.", "Indeed, we are expecting our economy to continue growing robustly with a rate of 5.6 per cent in real terms and 7.6 per cent in nominal terms during 2018.", "This growth is expected to reflect the increase in private consumption of 4.1 per cent and substantial growth in employment of 3.8 per cent, together with a very low unemployment rate of 4.2 per cent.", "Economic growth is expected to be also supported by a 7.8 per cent growth in investment.", "Meanwhile, inflation is expected to remain moderate at 1.5 per cent.", "With regards to the external trade sector, we are projecting a growth in exports of 2.5 per cent for the year 2018.", "This growth reflects a predicted increase in exports in a number of sectors including the financial, gaming and tourism sectors.", "10 In 2018, a surplus of 0.5 per cent is being forecasted, as the National Debt will continue to decrease to 50.8 per cent of GDP.", "Mr Speaker, before I come to the budgetary measures, I want to announce that I will not be introducing any new taxes during this budget, nor will I be increasing any existing tax rates be they direct or indirect.", "This includes any tax on income or on consumption.", "According to my information, this is the first time that this has ever happened in any post-election budget.", "We are able to do this because we can sensibly and responsibly say that our financial situation for 2018 will permit us to do so.", "\u20ac '000\n \u20ac '000\n \u20ac '000\n \u20ac '000\n \u20ac '000\n Table 1.1E english proj\n 08/10/2017 09:37\n \u20ac '000\n Table

generated.", "Although this gives us great satisfaction, we will not stop here.", "In observing our renewed mandate, we shall continue to strive with more incentives and measures to make our country a more inclusive society.", "2.1.", "The Cost of Living Adjustment The Cost Of Living Adjustment (COLA) for 2018 will be \u20ac1.75 weekly reflecting the adjustment for this year as announced in the last budget.", "2.2.", "An additional day of vacation leave One of the main measures mentioned in the electoral manifesto was that of giving back to employees the equivalent number of days as vacation leave for public holidays that fall on weekends.", "We believe that at a time when we are encouraging a better work-life balance and more quality time for families, such a measure is a necessity.", "Therefore, in the coming year, all employees will be given an additional day of vacation leave to compensate for those public holidays which fall on a weekend.", "The employees deserve this additional day of vacation leave since they are the main contributors to our flourishing economy.", "15 We are in discussions with all our social partners for the smooth running and implementation of this measure.", "2.3.", "Salary adjustment of employees earning a minimum wage The law that regulates the minimum wage is based on what is agreed on the Minimum Wage Standing Order and is adjusted yearly according to the Cost Of Living Adjustment (COLA).", "Thanks to the commitment of this Government and the sense of responsibility of our social partners, be it the unions and the employers, we have, during this year, signed a historic agreement on how the minimum wage is to be adjusted further.", "This agreement stipulates that employees, getting the minimum wage remuneration, will be given additional weekly increments apart from the COLA, as long as they would have been in employment for at least one year.", "In such a scenario, they are entitled to a weekly increase of \u20ac3 in their second year of employment and a further \u20ac3 weekly increase on their third year.", "Employees who earn more than the basic minimum wage would still be entitled for part of these increases on the second and third year of employment.", "This agreement also includes an additional supplement related to COLA.", "16 2.4.", "Further reduction in taxes for all employees We shall in this Budget honour another pledge mentioned in the electoral programme.", "We shall continue to reduce the tax on income.", "All those who earn less than \u20ac60,000 will benefit from this measure.", "For the first time ever, we are introducing a measure whereby even those who do not pay tax on employment income, will benefit from the \u2018refund\u2019.", "Those who earn less will be getting the highest tax refund.", "For the coming year, all those individuals who are in employment, whether in full or part-time work shall receive a cheque varying between \u20ac40 to a maximum of \u20ac68.", "The tax refund will be worked on the gross income that the employee would have earned the previous year.", "Nearly 200,000 employees shall benefit from this measure and it will cost the Government \u20ac10.6 million.", "(See table 2.1) 2.5.", "Increase in pensions During these last two years, senior citizens have had an increase in their pensions after a 25-year period during which time no adjustments to the pensions were made.", "17 Pensioners, confidently, and rightly so I say, expect a yearly improvement in their pensions.", "In the coming year, once again, we will be increasing their pensions.", "Mr Speaker, in this budget we shall be increasing the pension for every single pensioner.", "Every pensioner shall be benefitting from a weekly \u20ac2 increase in his or her pension, irrespective of whether one is receiving a contributory or a non-contributory pension.", "Over 90,000 pensioners shall benefit from this measure, which will cost a collective \u20ac9 million.", "2.6.", "Increase in the pension tax exempt capping Mr Speaker, this year we have introduced a fiscal reform to exempt pensioners from paying tax on income received from pensions.", "Over 22,000 pensioners benefitted from this measure of whom 9,000 pensioners stopped paying tax altogether.", "As was announced in the previous budget, this reform will continue next year.", "18 Furthermore, the ceiling on which income from pension is tax exempt will increase to \u20ac13,200.", "(See table 2.2) 2.7.", "Ex-Service Pensioners We shall continue allowing for an additional \u20ac200 for service pensions.", "Over 4,500 pensioners will benefit from this measure, which will cost the Government \u20ac1 million.", "2.8.", "\u20ac300 annual grant The \u20ac300 annual grant given to the elderly aged 75 years and over and are still living in their home, will again be paid in 2018.", "2.9.", "National Insurance contributions for pensioners in employment Senior citizens of pensionable age, who opt to remain in employment, are obliged to pay their National Insurance Contribution up to the age of 65 years.", "We have a situation whereby a number of employees, in particular female employees, who have not paid enough National Insurance contributions from their previous employment; thereby they are getting a lower pension worked on the amount of National Insurance contributions paid.", "19 As from 2018, pensioners who are 65 years or older shall have their pension adjusted to take into consideration the National Insurance contributions paid after pensionable age.", "Moreover, pensioners who have retired from work and are not yet 65 years of age and are engaged in a part-time work or are self-employed, will, as of next year, be able to pay the National Insurance contribution pro-rata at 15 per cent rate worked on their net income instead of the full rate, as is currently the case.", "2.10.", "Past injustices will continue to be addressed Mr President, in the previous budget, I announced the setting up of a special fund to address anomalies due to past changes in the pension systems.", "These anomalies were the cause of many injustices.", "As promised, over 6,000 beneficiaries or their heirs have started receiving monetary compensation.", "These are mainly former Labour Corps employees from the seventies, former port workers, former employees working at the Malta Electricity Board and police officers.", "Mr Speaker, this is another electoral promise we are honouring.", "We are allocating \u20ac10.5 million for the coming year to address these past injustices.", "20 2.11.", "Government Savings Bonds for pensioners After the overwhelming demand for the issuing of the 62+ Savings Bonds reserved for individuals aged 62 years and over, we shall be issuing a similar bond during the coming year.", "All this against a background of low interest rate on fixed savings being offered by commercial banks.", "2.12.", "Ex-gratia payment The Government will continue to make an ex-gratia payment related to VAT paid on registration tax to all those that had registered their vehicle during 2007.", "This measure will cost \u20ac4.9 million.", "2.13.", "Exemption of SMEs from charging VAT The Government is a firm believer that small and medium sized enterprises are the engine of our economy, thereby it will continue to support this sector and for the sector to continue to flourish.", "After 18 years of neglect, we are going to increase the threshold below which SMEs will be allowed not to charge VAT while at the same time they will not claim any VAT paid by them.", "The present capping of \u20ac14,000 is going to be increased to \u20ac20,000.", "21 2.14.", "Alignment of excise duty on steel rods and bars Existing anomalies in the excise duty applicable to steel rods and bars falling under a particular HS Code, shall be eliminated through the alignment of excise duty applicable on the importation of similar products.", "This is to create a level playing field where importation is concerned.", "2.15.", "Clamping down on tax evasion This Government intends to continue with its fight against tax evasion.", "Heavier fines shall be issued for both court and out-of-court cases that deal with tax evasion.", "The Joint Enforcement Task Force will strengthen its drive towards companies and businesses that are evading tax.", "2.16.", "Addressing poverty and social benefits dependence The Government aims to continue with and to strengthen the initiatives introduced in recent years that have had a positive effect in moving individuals off social benefits.", "These \u201cmaking work pay\u201d initiatives have provided pathways for claimants especially for women to leave the benefit system and enter the labour market.", "22 2.17.", "Extension of the In-Work Benefit scheme When it comes to the In-work Benefit scheme, for this Budget the Government will be focussing on those families where only one parent is in employment.", "The highest rate of In-Work Benefit will be increased from \u20ac350 to \u20ac450 per child, while the lowest will increase from \u20ac52 to \u20ac75 per child.", "It will still be more beneficial for the second
