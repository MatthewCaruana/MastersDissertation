1. Economic Prospects 
Overview of the current situation and outlook for the 
coming years 
Following the robust growth registered in 2014, the Maltese 
economy continued to grow at an average rate of 5.1% in real 
terms in the first half of 2015. This growth rate is almost three 
times the average registered in the Euro Zone. During the same 
period, labour market developments strengthened significantly as 
gains in employment were coupled with a falling unemployment 
rate. 
During the first half of this year, the Maltese economy expanded 
by 5.1 per cent in real terms. The Gross Value Added (GVA) 
increased by 7.0 per cent attributed to increases registered in all 
sectors of the economy with the exception of the manufacturing 
sector which decreased by 0.9 per cent. The latter was the result of 
a fall in the manufacture of computer, electronics, and optical 
products registered in the first quarter. However, in the second 
quarter of 2015, the manufacturing sector grew by 4.7 per cent. 
Considerable increases were registered in the professional, 
scientific and technical activities sector, real estate activities, in the 
public sector, in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector, in 
wholesale and retail trade, the transport and accommodation 
sector, in the financial services sector, and in the information and 
communication sector. During the same period of this year, both 
compensation of employees and gross operating surplus 
performed positively, expanding by 4.1 per cent and 10.4 per cent, 
respectively. Meanwhile, net taxes on production and imports 
increased by an average rate of 7.5 per cent. 
The Maltese economy is expected to remain positive in the second 
half of 2015. Overall growth in 2015 is expected to reach 4.2 per 
 
2 
 
cent in real terms, sustained primarily by positive developments 
in the domestic sector of the economy, while the external side of 
the economy is expected to have a negative contribution on 
economic growth, reflecting the surge in imports of investment 
goods in the energy sector. Private consumption is expected to 
increase by 3.5 per cent in real terms, sustained by a moderate 
growth in employment, growth in disposable income which in 
turn reflects higher wages. Government expenditure is projected 
to rise by 1.0 per cent in 2015, as a result of increases in 
compensation of employees and Government consumption of 
goods and services. Investment is expected to remain strong in the 
second half of the year and increase by 21.4 per cent in 2015, 
mainly as a result of projects in the energy sector. Exports are 
expected to remain at the same level of 2014 while the strong 
domestic demand is expected to drive up imports by 1.4 per cent. 
During 2016, economic growth is expected to retain a brisk 
momentum although it is expected to be slightly more moderate. 
Economic growth in 2016 is expected to be 3.6 per cent in real 
terms, with the external side of the economy largely accounting 
for all the expected growth. Domestic demand is expected to 
contribute positively by 0.3 percentage points.  This is because the 
positive performances expected in both private and public 
consumption will be neutralized by a slowdown in investment. It 
is however worth noting that the drop in investment in 2016 is a 
result of the surge in 2015 and is related to the outlay of EU 
Structural Funds. However, investment as a ratio of Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) is expected to remain at a healthy 19.6 
per cent in real terms, 1.5% higher than the investment ratio 
characterizing the Maltese economy since 2009. Positive external 
developments are expected to remain strong reflecting the 
stronger performance of Malta’s main trading partners. The 
depreciation of the Euro against other currencies also had a 
positive effect both directly and indirectly in that it strengthened 
 
3 
 
the economic performance of our main trading partners. Other 
export oriented sectors are expected to register moderate gains 
whilst the electronics is anticipated to recover in 2016, despite 
registering slower growth rates.  
Table 1.1 represents the main macroeconomic indicators for the 
years 2012–2016. The figures for the 2012-2014 period are based on 
the latest data released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) 
under the new European System of National and Regional 
Accounts (ESA 2010) whereas the figures presented for 2015 and 
2016 are based on the autumn forecasts.

Assumptions for Projections  
The macroeconomic forecasts presented in this Draft Budgetary 
Plan are based on the following assumptions:  
• Economic activity in Malta’s main trading partners is expected 
to increase by 1.5 % and 2.0 % in 2015 and 2016, respectively.  
• Oil prices are expected to decrease to US$57.1 per barrel in 
2015 and to increase to US$63.0 per barrel in 2016.  
• Short-term interest rate is expected to average 0.05 % in 2015 
and to remain the same thereafter. On the other hand, the long-
term interest rate is expected to average at 1.6 %in 2015 and to 
remain the same in 2016. 
• The nominal effective exchange rate is expected to fall to an 
average of 0.975 in 2015, reflecting the expected depreciation of 
the Euro exchange rate to both the Dollar and the Sterling, and 
to marginally decrease to 0.9502 in 2016. Specifically, the 
USD/EUR exchange rate is expected to average 1.0897 in 2015 
and to 1.0718 in 2016, whilst the STG/ EUR exchange rate is 
expected to average 0.7103 and 0.7075 in 2015 and 2016, 
respectively. 
• It is being assumed that, Government expenditure moderates 
in the second half of 2015 
• Changes in inventory are assumed not to contribute materially 
to GDP growth.

Risks to Outlook 
The economic outlook in this Budgetary Plan is more positive than 
the one projected in Spring 2015. This is mainly due to the higher 
than expected economic growth rate registered in the first half of 
2015 together with a more favourable outlook in the exchange 
rate. Nevertheless, there is still an element of prudence in this 
forecast. This means that the risk is primarily on the favourable 
side. Whilst the volatility of investment may be a risk factor, this 
risk is limited due to its concomitance on imports. This means that 
were this investment not to materialise it would have minimal 
impact on the Gross Domestic Product. 
For 2016, the risk balance is related to external conditions which 
might be more moderate than forecasted whilst on the domestic 
front, it is very likely that performance will be more robust than 
projected. This is because the growth forecast for 2016 is based on 
a relatively moderate growth in employment which contrasts 
sharply with recent performance. A stronger element of growth in 
employment coupled by consumer confidence and a low interest 
rate could stimulate private consumption beyond these relatively 
prudent forecasts. Private investment could also be stronger than 
expected. It should be noted that these forecasts include the 
positive impact of lower energy costs on private investment which 
might therefore be more robust than projected.    
 
Employment Prospects  
The Labour Force Survey (LFS) recorded an employment rate of 
63.9% in the second quarter of 2015, an increase of 1.4% when 
compared to the corresponding quarter in 2014. Growth in 
employment is expected to remain strong and increase by 1.9% in 
2015. On the other hand, employment growth is expected to 
remain at the same level in 2016 at 2.0%. Consequently, the 
unemployment rate (based on a Harmonised definition according 
 
7 
 
to the Eurostat) is expected to decrease by 0.1 percentage points to 
5.8% in 2015 and to further decrease by 0.2 percentage points to 
5.6% in 2016. This is far below the expected EU average rate and 
reflects efforts in ongoing active labour market policies.  
In 2015, all sectors are expected to register positive growth rates in 
employment. This positive performance is expected to be largely 
due to a higher female employment rate, reflecting increased 
efforts by Government to increase female participation, and 
increased employment flexibility. In the second quarter of this 
year, female participation in the workforce increased by 3.0% 
when compared with the same quarter of 2014. 
 
Inflation  
The HICP inflation rate (on a twelve month average) stood at 0.8% 
in 2014, mainly due to the negative growth rates registered in 
energy prices. Inflation is expected to marginally increase by 0.2 
percentage points to 1.0 per cent in 2015. As oil prices are expected 
to increase relative to 2015 while the USD/Euro exchange rate is 
expected to remain largely the same, inflation is expected to 
increase to 1.8 per cent in 2016.  
 
Comparison to Commission’s Spring Forecast  
The Spring Forecast published by the European Commission 
project a growth rate for Malta of 3.6% in 2015 and 3.2% in 2016, 
with domestic demand being the main motor of growth in both 
years. Therefore, forecasts for real GDP growth presented in this 
Plan are 0.6 percentage points and 0.4 percentage points higher 
than the rate forecasted by the Commission. This is attributed to a 
higher than expected contribution from domestic demand for 
2015, while for 2016 the composition of growth differs because the 
Commission is expecting growth to be primarily generated by the 
 
8 
 
domestic side of the economy. On the other hand, the Ministry for 
Finance is expecting growth for 2016 to be generated mainly from 
the external side of the economy.  
Nominal growth of the Gross Domestic Product presented in this 
Budgetary Plan is projected at 6.5% and 6.2% for 2015 and 2016, 
respectively. For 2015 and 2016, this represents a higher growth of 
1.5 percentage points and 1.1 percentage points respectively over 
that presented by the Commission in its Spring Forecast. The 
European Commission will update its forecasts in the coming 
weeks in its Autumn Forcast.  
 
Growth of Economic Potential 
The average growth of economic potential during the period 2006 
to 2014 stood at 2.4%. Over the period 2015 to 2018, potential 
output growth is expected to gradually increase. In fact, this is 
expected to be 3.4%, mainly due to strong investment, positive 
employment growth, higher labour market participation rates and 
improvements in the total productivity factor.

2. Public Finances 
2.1 Correcting Excessive deficit 
Malta took effective action to reduce the Government deficit 
below the 3.0% threshold by the end of 2013. Subsequently, 
Government continued on the path of growth-friendly fiscal 
consolidation which led to a further decline of the deficit from 
2.6% in 2013 to 2.1% of GDP in 2014. This means an annual deficit-
GDP improvement of 0.5%. This reduction was reflected in the 
debt as a percentage of the GDP declined from 69.2% in 2013 to 
68.3% in 2014. 
These positive results led the European Commission, in June of 
this year, to declare Malta had exited the Excessive Deficit 
Procedure which we had entered in 2013 when the deficit for 2012 
had shot up to 3.6%. 
Malta's exit from the Excessive Deficit Procedure is expected to 
boost Malta's credibility both within the European Union as well 
as with other international institutions such as the International 
Monetary Fund. This result will also help improve Malta's credit 
classification since sustainability in public finances, together with 
other indicators, is one of the main criteria on which credit rating 
agencies base their classification. Moreover, lower deficit ratios 
sustain declines in public debt, freeing up a larger part of 
government revenue for other priority sectors.  
 
2.2 Deficit 
2.21 Developments in the Consolidated Fund 
In line with Government's fiscal targets, in the first 8 months of 
this year, the deficit in the consolidated fund declined by €68.9 
million, from €209.9 million in the period January to August 2014 
to €141.0 million.  This reduction was primarily the result of a 
 
17 
 
significant increase in revenue from direct and indirect taxation 
which reflected the more robust economic growth, higher profits 
for enterprises and salaries, as well as greater efficiency in revenue 
collection between January and August of this year.

2.22 Recurrent Revenue 
During the first eight months of 2015, recurrent revenue increased 
by €235.6 million to €2,222.4 million. This reflected the substantial 
increases registered in both tax and non-tax revenue.  
Tax revenue increased by €185.3 million in the period January to 
August of this year, reaching €1,918.5 million. This increase was 
mainly characterised by the robust performance of indirect tax 
revenue, which during this period increased by €100.4 million. 
This reflected an increase of €63.3 million in revenue from customs 
and excise duties which was the result in the increment of revenue 
 
19 
 
from excise duty on petroleum as Enemalta continues to pay its 
arrears, as well as excise duty on tobacco products and cement.  
There was also an increase of €19.0 million from licences, taxes 
and fines, as well as an increase of €18.1 million in value added 
tax, where the increase in the latter reflected both higher domestic 
consumption as well as increased tourist spending in Malta. 
Another principal contributor underpinning this positive revenue 
performance was the revenue from direct taxes. Indeed, in the first 
eight months of this year, revenue from direct taxes rose by €84.8 
million to reach a total of €1,137.4 million. This increase was 
supported both by a rise of €64.9 million from income tax 
revenues, while social security contributions increased by €19.9 
million in the same period. This revenue growth reflects higher 
profits registered by both foreign and local companies in Malta.  It 
also resulted from the substantial increase in jobs on the domestic 
labour market, particularly the increase in the rate of female 
participation supported by measures to encourage and incentivise 
female labour market participation. 
Non-tax revenue increased by €50.3 million in the first eight 
months of this year, when compared with the same period last 
year, to reach €340.0 million. The biggest increase was registered 
in the level of European Union funding, and the effect of this 
increase was somewhat neutral for deficit purposes since capital 
expenditure then goes up by the same amount.  A substantial 
increase in income from non-tax revenue, dividends on 
investment, and fees of office was also registered.  
 
2.23 Recurrent and Capital Expenditure 
During the first eight months of 2015, total Government 
expenditure, including recurrent and capital expenditure as well 
as interest on debt, increased by €166.7 million to €2,363.4 million. 
 
20 
 
This was primarily due to higher recurrent expenditure and also 
increases in capital expenditure. 
Recurrent expenditure increased by €148.5 million over the same 
period of last year, with the largest increase registered in 
programmes and Initiatives amounting to €83.0 million.  These 
reflected higher outlays on various measures and initiatives in 
priority sectors such as social security, education, health, tourism 
and payments of EU own resources. Indeed, in social security the 
variance reflected an increase in expenditure on retirement 
pensions, the one-time additional bonus announced in the Budget 
for 2015 and an increase in State social security contribution.  In 
the health sector, the increase related to higher expenditure on 
medicines and surgical material. As regards the education sector, 
higher outlays were recorded in support of Church schools and 
towards the provision of free childcare services.  
During the same period, an increase of €25.0 million was 
registered in Contributions to Government Entities which reflects, 
amongst others, higher allocations for post-secondary and tertiary 
education and allocations towards the creative economy and some 
hospitals.  During the same period there was also an increase of 
€23.1 million in Personal Emoluments reflecting increases 
registered in respect of employment and salaries and wages 
primarily in the health and education sectors.  Meanwhile, 
Operational and Maintenance Expenditure increased by €17.4 
million primarily due to higher allocations for contractual services 
in health and elderly care as well as increases in rents and 
transport services in the education sector. 
Capital expenditure increased by €17.3 million to reach €271.4 
million by August of this year. The increase in capital expenditure 
reflected higher infrastructural and social capital outlays over the 
same period in 2014. 
 
21 
 
Over the same period, interest on public debt increased 
marginally by €0.9 million to €152.7 million. 
 
2.24 Deficit in the coming years 
Government is committed to continue reducing the deficit in a 
sustainable manner in the coming years.  Government's budgetary 
targets are displayed in Table 2.2.  As shown in the Table, the 
deficit is targeted to decline by an average of 0.5 percentage points 
per year.  This means that this year the deficit is targeted to 
decline to 1.6% of GDP, further going down to 1.1% in 2016.  
While in 2015, the anticipated narrowing of the deficit is expected 
to be mainly revenue-based, supported by buoyant economic 
growth, fiscal consolidation in 2016 is anticipated to be primarily 
expenditure-based. In this manner, the deficit is expected to 
decline to a marginal amount of 0.2% by 2018 and disappear in the 
following years. In structural terms the deficit is anticipated to 
decline by an average of 0.5% of GDP both this year and in 2016.

2.25 Debt 
As a percentage of GDP the debt has declined from 69.6% in 2013 
to 68.3% in 2014.  In the coming years the general Government 
gross debt ratio is expected to decrease by a further 1.7 percentage 
points of GDP in 2015 and by a further 1.3 percentage points in 
2016, reaching 65.2 per cent of GDP.  The positive impact of the 
anticipated nominal growth and the projected primary surplus 
will more than offset the negative impact of the interest burden 
and the stock-flow adjustment.  More details are displayed in 
Table 2.3.

2.4 Conclusion 
In 2014, the deficit declined to 2.1% of GDP whilst the debt went 
down to 68.3% of GDP.  For this year, the figures of the 
consolidated fund for the first eight months show that 
Government is on the right path to reach its fiscal targets.  
Nevertheless, Government is committed to continue monitoring 
public finances to make sure the deficit and public debt keep to 
their downward trajectory in the coming years.

3. Budgetary Measures 2016 
 
A. Fiscal Policy 
3.1  
Adjustment of Income Tax Rates 
For the second year running, Government will be reducing 
Income Tax.  As in the previous Budger, persons with an 
income from employment or pension not exceeding the 
minimum wage will once again not be liable to tax. 
Moreover, all whoever did not benefit from the reductions 
of income tax effected during this administration will start 
doing so now. 
The table displays the new tax computation which will be 
applicable to declarations as single, as well as married and 
parent declarations.

3.3  
Income Tax Rate reduced to 7.5% for athletes and 
players in all sport 
In the budget for 2014 we had introduced a reduced rate of 
income tax of 7.5% for football players. Last year we 
extended this benefit to waterpolo players.  As of this year 
we are further extending this favourable rate of 7.5% to 
athletes and players in all sport. This favourable rate of 
income tax will also be applicable to coaches.   
 
3.4  
Reduced rate of VAT (7%) on all sport facilities 
VAT on all sporting facilities, including gym memberships, 
fitness centres, football nurseries and other activities from 
18% to 7% in a drive to promote sport and a healthy 
lifestyle. 
 
3.5  
15% Tax Rate on Police Extra Duty 
As promised, we are continuing our policy of improving 
working conditons for members of the Police Force. 
Effective 1st January 2016, payments made to members of 
the Police Force for extra duty which is carried out for the 
benefit of organizations, individuals and companies, will 
be taxed separately at the rate of 15%. 
 
3.6  
Extension of the In-Work Benefit 
In this Budget, Government wants to acknowledge those 
families made up of couples where only one person is 
employed in a low paid job and where there are dependent 
children under the age of 23.  Thus the In-Work benefit will 
 
30 
 
be extended to those families who are dependent on a 
single earner, declaring an income in the range between 
€6,600 and €12,700. The maximum benefit will be of €150 
for every child.  
Around 3,700 families and almost 5,000 boys and girls, 
many of whom are at risk of poverty, will be benefitting 
from this measure.  
The incentive for the second parent to enter the labour 
force will be kept in place.  In fact, where both parents are 
gainfully employed, the benefit goes up to a maximum of 
€1,000 for every child. 
3.7  
Guaranteed National Minimum Pension 
The committment for a Guaranteed National Minimum 
Pension will continue as of 1st Jauary 2016 when 12,000 
elderly persons will benefit from an increment in their 
pension. Next year the minimum amount payable for a 
contributory pension, including the bonus,  for those with 
sufficient contributions will be €7,280 per annum or €140 
per week. Pensioners with insufficient contributions will 
receive payments pro rata. 
The increase in pensions for those who will be benefitting 
from this measure will be of €8.92 weekly for those aged 75 
and over and of €8 weekly for those below 75 years.  
Married couples who currently receive the minimum 
pension for married persons and who will not benefit from 
the above measure will also be given increased payments 
beyond the COLA to a total amount of €4.15 per week. 
More than 12,000 persons will benefit from this provision. 
 
31 
 
3.8  
Widows' Pension 
Another measure coming into force concerns surviving 
spouses who were gainfully occupied and were entitled to 
a retirement pension but lost this entitlement when they 
were widowed and started receiving the widow/ers' 
pension.  As of next year they will start receiving the full 
married couples pension and not merely the 5/6 they are 
receiving to date. Government believes this measure will 
go some way to compensate those surviving spouses who 
had paid social security contributions during their working 
lives which are not being reflected in their current pension.  
This measure will cost €1.7 million in 2016. 
 
3.9  
Carers Pension 
The two schemes currently in effect, that is the Carers 
Pension and the Social Assistance for Carers, will be 
revised 
and 
amalgamated 
within 
one 
framework.  
Eligibility for the new scheme will also be revised and 
widened allowing more people who care for the elderly in 
their own homes to benefit from the revised scheme, thus 
helping more elderly persons to continue living in their 
own homes. 
 
32 
 
3.10  Credit for child rearing and family growth 
Another two proposals in the pension reform which will 
come into force relate to credit for contibutions made by 
parents who stopped working to rear their children.  The 
credits for those persons born from 1952 onwards will be 
practically doubled and this will benefit numerous mothers 
who will benefit from better pensions in future. 
Parents born between 1952 and 1961 will be given two 
years' credit for each child and parents born after the latter 
date will be given 4 years' credit for each child up to a 
maximum of 12 years. The current link with the number of 
years a parent needs to have worked following the birth of 
offspring will no longer apply. 
Nevertheless, parents born from 1962 onwards will receive 
a further credit of an additonal two years from each child 
beyond the third, provided that they would have returned 
to work for a period equivalent to that for which credit is 
given.  
 
33 
 
3.11  Study, Training and Pensions 
The concept of credit for years spent in study and 
specialization as well as years spent in training and life 
long learning will be introduced for the first time ever. This 
should help in promoting human capital development. 
Crtedits will be given and can be accumulated for each 
MQF level reached and will be given during the study 
period.   
 
These credits will be given as shown in the table below: 
 
 
Born between       
1952-1961 
Born in 1962 or later

3.12  Pensions Sustainability  
For the pensions system in our country to remain 
sustainable we need to balance entitlements with 
obligations. Government remains committed to neither 
raising the age of retirement nor increasing the rate of 
social 
security 
contributions. 
However 
Government 
believes there should be a fair and just balance between the 
number of years one spends paying contributions and the 
number of years one is expected to be on a pension, which 
principle should help in guaranteeing the sustainability of 
the pensions system.    
At the same time we want to incentivise more people who, 
strictly on a voluntary basis and in agreement with their 
employer, choose to remain in the labour force.  Those who 
stay in employment and do not apply for a pension when 
they are entitled to will be given an incentive for every 
year. 
 
3.13  Encouraging investment in Third Pillar Pensions 
A gainfully occupied person who utilises these incentives 
for his/herself may also contribute up to one thousand 
Euros for the benefit of their partner and receive another 
€150 in income tax incentive. These may also be given for 
schemes undertaken in the name of offspring below the 
age of 16. 
Employers may make a volutary contribution in scheme on 
befalf of their employees and receive a tax credit for such 
contribution. (This means that for thousand Euros invested  
the company would be saving around €350 in tax the 
following year.) 
 
35 
 
3.14  Other measures relating to Pensioners 
We shall be introducing a measure intended to raise the 
rate of pension payable to those persons who started their 
working life in well paying jobs and who therefore paid 
contributions at a high rate but who, because of 
circumstances beyond their control, eventually ventured 
into a business as self-employed, which business did not 
do well.   These circumstances constrained such persons to 
pay low contributions and consequently they are now 
receiving a low rate of pension. 
 
3.15  A pension as of first day 
Pensioners and their surviving spouses will henceforth 
receive their pension from the day after which their 
employment comes to an end or from the date of the death 
of their partner. In any one year this measure benefits 
around 2,800 persons.  
 
3.16  Services Pensions 
We shall continue allocating an additional €200 from the 
estimated services pension for the purposes of of the social 
security pension. This measure will cost around €1.6 
million and will effect 5,000 pensioners. 
 
3.17  Disability Pension 
On reaching pensionable age, persons with disability will 
be entitled to a pension equivalent to the non contributory 
retirement pension. 
 
36 
 
3.18  Pension Anomalies 
Over the years a number of anomalies developed in the 
pensions system which effected various categories of 
workers, among them  former members of the labour 
corps, former employees of the Electricity Board and 
others. Government has already addressed several of these 
anomalies but more remains to be done. These anomalies 
are being considered with a view to finding  solutions that 
are just and sustainable. Government is therefore 
reiterating its committment to take the necessary measures 
to resolve these anomalies over a reasonable period of 
time. 
 
3.19  Grants to persons over 75 
Elderly persons aged 75 and over will continue to receive 
the grant of €300 per year.  
 
3.20  Former SeaMalta seamen 
Talks are at an advanced stage between Government and 
ex-SeaMalta seamen with a view to concluding once and 
for all, the claim they still have pending before the law 
courts.  
 
37 
 
3.21  Malta Community Chest Fund 
Companies making donations of not less than 2,000 Euros 
to the Community Chest Fund during the year 2015 will be 
given a rebate on their income tax return equivalent to 100 
per cent of their donation. We would thus be incentivising 
and acknowledging the philanthropic assistance accorded 
by these companies.  
 
3.22  Pilot Fund for Live-in Carers 
A one million Euro fund will be set to help families who 
care for an elderly dependent who needs constant 
supervision.  Government intends to subsidise the wages 
payable to qualified carers employed on a full-time or part-
time basis.  Part-time engagements would be subsidised 
pro-rata.  
It is estimated that around 160 elderly persons will benefit 
from this fund. 
 
3.23  Abbreviation of time for sale of inherited property 
One of the major causes of vacant properties is litigation 
between heirs. The current position is that if  51 per cent of 
heirs agree on a sale price of immovable property and the 
other heirs disagree, the property can only be sold after ten 
or five years from the opening of succession, depending on 
the date of such succession. Therefore, in order to minimise 
this phenomenon of vacant properties, this period of ten or 
five years will be reduced to three years with respect to all 
immovable property already inherited or yet to be 
inherited.  
 
38 
 
3.24  Reduction of stamp duty on purchase of property in  
Urban Conservation Areas 
In the coming year, the stamp duty payable on the 
purchase of property within Urban Conservations Areas  
will be reduced from 5% to 2.5%. 2016 will also see the 
reduction of  the property sales tax from 8% cent to 5% for 
owners selling refurbished property. This is intended to 
encourage the refurbishment and purchase of old, vacant 
premises. Thus we would be conserving the heritage of 
historic buildings.  This measure would be only applicable 
in 2016. 
 
3.25  Exemption for First Time Buyers 
The exemption from stamp duty for first time buyers will 
be extended. 
This government has worked and will continue to work for 
a strong economy and we want our young people to 
benefit from it.  We are therefore renewing the exemption 
up till the end of next year so that young couple can save 
up to €5,000 on their first property.  This will be back dated 
to the date of convenia entered into since 1st July, 2015, 
corresponding to the closing date of the last scheme.   
Those first time buyers who entered convenia or contracts 
of sale after the 1st July will be refunded the stamp duty 
they may have paid.  
 
39 
 
3.26  Revision of Depreciation Calculation 
Service industries, such as financial services and iGaming, 
have gained prominence in the Maltese economy over the 
years giving rise to a number of ancillary services such as 
the leasing of office space. With a view to  boosting this 
industry as well as the operators of these ancillary services, 
as of 2016,  entrepreneurs investing in premises intended 
for use as office space will be  able to benefit from existing 
legislation which offers the possibility of claiming 
depreciation on  capital expenditure and which currently 
applies only to industrial buildings, hotels and car parks. 
 
3.27  Fiscal Consolidation in Income Tax Legislation 
We are working on the introduction of the concept of fiscal 
consolidation in income tax legislation which will permit 
companies belonging to the same proprietors to declare 
their income as an aggregate, as if they were one company. 
This would further simplify the computation of income 
both for themselves as well as for the Department of Inland 
Revenue. 
 
 
40 
 
3.28  Reduced Tax on Commerical Leases 
In the Budget for 2014 we introduced the option for 
property owners of paying a withholding tax of 15 per cent 
on leases of residential properties. This was a very 
favourable measure since it meant a reduction of tax on 
residential property leases in place of the normal rates of 
tax which could go up to 25%.  
This concession is now being extended to commercial 
leases and therefore, as of next year, all income deriving 
from the leas of property will be subject to a final 
withholding tax of 15%. 
Companies that for part of the same group of companies 
and who lease properties to each other will be excluded. 
 
3.29  Fines on Abandoned Commercial Property 
Government wishes to improve the environment in which 
we live.  Abandoned property is a major eyesore in 
numerous localities. For this purpose Government will 
launch a process of public consultation with the aim of 
drawing up a plan to establish legal obligations making it 
mandatory 
for 
commercial 
property 
be 
properly 
maintained and to set out the sanctions applicable in 
default. The focus will initially be on commercial 
properties - such as showrooms - which are left derelict 
and open to easy access and which, in certain cases, pose a 
clear danger to health and safety.   
 
 
41 
 
3.30  Refund of VAT paid on Car Registration Tax 
As promised, we continued to make ex-gratia payments 
related to registration tax paid in excess by persons 
registering vehicles between 1st May 2004 and 31st 
December 2008. So far we have paid out €5.4 million in 
refunds on excess tax where this year we refunded the 
whole amount of excess tax paid by those who registered 
their vehicles between 1st May and 31st December 2004. 
This year this ex-gratia refund will be made to all those 
who registered their vehicles during 2005.  Therefore 
another scheme will come into force next year for vehicle 
registrations made between 1st January and 31st December 
2005, applicable to all cases that were eligible when the 
scheme was first launched in 2014. This means that by the 
end of next year we would have refunded a total of €9.7 
million in tax levied in excess. 
 
 
42 
 
3.31  Revenue Measures 
Excise duty on fuel will go up by 3c on petrol and 3c of 
diesel, for every litre.  
Although excise duty will be revised up, the prices of fuel 
will still be reduced as of January 2016 because Enemed 
has finalised an agreement through which the price of 
petrol can be reduced by 3 Euro cents whilst the price of 
diesel will be reduced by 4 Euro cents per litre.  
Also revised up will be the excise duty on tobacco 
products, lubricating oil and cement. The Eco-contribution 
applicable to plastic carrier bags, containers for beer, wine 
and fermented drinks, intermediate products, alcoholic 
and non-alcoholic beverages as well as chewing gum will 
be removed.  Therefore, in order to hold firm our message 
for a clean environment as well as to facilitate enforcement 
and eliminate abuse, this will be replaced by excise duties. 
The applicable rates are displayed in the Annex to the 
Budget Speech. 
 
 
3.32  Individual Investment Programme 
To date the Individual Investment Programme has yielded 
€75 million. 70% of these funds will be allocated to the 
National Fund for Social Development set up in the past 
weeks.    This is the first time that Malta will have a Fund 
of this nature whose aim is to be forward looking and 
investing for the general good of the country. 
 
 
43 
 
3.33  Environmental Contribution 
Our country is well on its way to hosting around 2 million 
tourists a year and this at greater profit for the private 
sector. Whilst the growth of tourism is generating wealth 
in the economy, we must ensure that the country has the 
necessary 
quality 
infrastructure 
to 
sustain 
this 
development. 
Government 
has 
decided 
that 
an 
environmental contribution be levied as of 1st April 2016, 
payable by all tourists above the age of 18 who visit our 
country. This will be a low rate of 50 Euro cents for each 
night spent in Malta but capped at a maximum for 5 Euros 
for each continuous stay. For this purpose discussions will 
be held with all stake holders regarding the best 
implementation of this measure.  
The revenue from this measure, which is estimated to be 
around 6 million Euros, will be administered by the 
Foundation for the Development of Tourist Zones for the 
purpose of upgrading, improving and maintaining the 
major public zones in the country.   
 
3.34  Reform of the Eco-Contribution 
This year saw the implementation of the first phase of the 
reform 
of 
the 
Eco-contribution. 
The 
judicious 
implementation of this reform allowed the seamless 
application of the Waste Electrical and Electronic 
Equipment Directive for the safeguard of the environment.  
Through 
this 
Budget 
we are removing 
the 
Eco-
Contribution of drink containers, chewing gum and plastic 
carrier bags.  This will be replaced by excise duties. 
We feel that the time has come to implement the final 
 
44 
 
 
 
 
phase of this reform. Therefore, after the necessary 
consultation with the stakeholders concerned, Government 
intends to roll out the process of the total elimination of 
this contribution, which process is expected to be finalised 
but 1st September 2016. 
 
45 
 
B. Encouraging more Participation in the Labour 
Force 
4.1  
Childcare 
This year we shall continue with the free Childcare 
programme. Malta is the only European country to 
offer this type of incentive. Through this bold 
investment, numerous women are joining the work 
force for the first time, and families are benefitting 
from Government support apart from saving 
around €5,000 for each child. This is money that 
remains in the pockets of families in Malta and 
Gozo. 
 
4.2  
New Childcare Centres 
New Childcare Centres will be opened for the 
uptake of infants in Haż-Zebbuġ, St Julians and 
Marsascala. 
 
4.3  
Paid Study Leave Scheme for Teachers 
The Paid Study Leave Scheme (Sabbatical) for 
teachers announced last year will and extended 
and expanded. The scheme offers paid leave for 
education officers to invest in their professional 
development through the improvement of their 
professional or academic qualifications. 
 
46 
 
4.4  
Immigration Work Office 
We are exploring the concept of an Immigration 
Work Office with a view to minimising illegal job 
seeking by immigrants. This will take the shape of 
Job Brokerage Offices in the open centres in Marsa 
and Ħal Far where the idea revolves round the 
conept of Public Private Partnerships providing a 
system of work vouchers involving both workers 
and employers. 
4.5  
Leave for IVF Treatment 
Following the introduction of parental leave for 
adopting parents, now we shall be extending this 
benefit to couples who need to undergo IVF 
treatment.   
4.6  
Aġenzija Żgħażagħ 
Aġenzija Żgħażagħ will be drawing up a work 
programme for the Youth Village and will embark 
on the second phase of the programme which 
envisages a residential centre facilitation young 
people in organizing youth exchanges and other 
mobility projects. The Youth Help pilot project will 
be followed up by the Outreach and Detached 
Youth Help projects involving interaction with 
youths on the streets of Valletta, Birżebbuġa, 
Marsascala, Żurrieq and Cottonera. Special care 
will be taken to ensure schools provide a safe 
environment for young LGBTIQ students with 
adequate procedures in place to tackle cases of 
bullying on LGBTIQ students. 
 
47 
 
4.7  
ETC to become Job Centre Plus 
As already announced, once the new Legal Notice 
is approved, the Employment and Training 
Corporation (ETC) will be known as Job Centre 
Plus. It is expected that the training of job seekers 
and employees will commence in the coming 
weeks.  The system will be made available to all by 
the beginning of the new year. 
 
4.8  
Youth Guarantee 
In the first two years since the implementation of 
the Youth Guarantee, youth unemployment went 
down from 14.0% to 8.7%. This is among the best 
performances registered in member countries of 
the European Union. The success achieved fills us 
with courage and therefore this guarantee will 
continue to be offered in the coming years.  
 
4.9  
Job Practice Scheme 
Through the Job Practice initiative, MCAST 
students will be offered an opportunity to widen 
their skills portfolio. This will ensure that, as far as 
is possible, these students find the employment 
that matches their qualifications.  
 
48 
 
4.10  Access to Employment 
Various will be launched during the coming 
months to attract more people into the labour force.  
The ETC has activated the Work Programme, 
whereby three private operators will be assisting in 
finding work placements for those registering for 
work.  As of this November Government will be 
launching the Access to Employment initiative 
(A2E).  This scheme will be giving assistance to 
enterprises to promote job opportunities for those 
unemployed 
persons 
who 
are 
the 
most 
disadvantaged and who are seeking employment. 
The scheme is co-financed by the European Social 
Fund.  The ETC will be issuing payments every six 
months and is committed to do this within a few 
weeks after the payments fall due.  
 
49 
 
4.11  Precarious Work 
The pegging of salaries is now being implement 
whereby, for the first time, workers employed by 
contractors to the public sector whose contract 
expired or was due to expire during this year, 
would benefit from the basic wage payable to state 
workers for indentical work, upon renewal of the 
contract. This pegging will now be extended to 
contracts of service with government departments 
and other entities in the public sector relative to 
contracts expiring during 2016. 
With a view to ensuring that working conditions 
legislation is enforced, in the coming weeks 
Government 
will 
be 
engaging 
seven 
work 
inspectors and other staff who will also enforce 
Government regulations against precarious work. 
The Department Of Industrial and Employment 
Relations will be publishing a Charter to   be  
distributed to all households in Malta and Gozo so 
that 
all 
concerned, 
 
including 
workers 
in 
vulnerable sectors, would be made aware of the 
basic conditions they are entitled to in their 
respective work place.  
 
50 
 
4.12  Online registration of Employment Contracts 
In agreement with the social partners represented 
on the MCESD, Government is exploring ways to 
ensure that basic rights would be automatically 
incorporated in employment contracts. The idea is 
to make templates of various contracts available 
online and made accessible for download by 
everyone. Thus we will be ensuring that all 
workers would have an employment contract that 
reflects the conditions stipulated by law.  
 
4.13  Co-operatives 
The consultation regarding a holistic reform of co-
operatives is still ongoing. This reform includes a 
revision of the rules regulating the Co-operatives 
Central Fund and amendments to co-operatives 
legislation, including the minimum number of 
worker members required for the formation of a 
co-operative. 
 
4.14  Labour Market Research 
A unit of labour market analysts will be set up to 
carry out research in this field. The aim is to have a 
continuing analysis of the labour market to identify 
trends and shortcomings in a timely manner and 
for these to be addressed scientifically.  
 
 
 
51 
 
4.15  Health and Safety in the Workplace. 
The Occupational Health and Safety Authority 
(OHSA) will continue its committment to facilitate 
the process of compliance with the requirements of 
the law by all concerned.  
In this regard it will continue with its process of 
simplification of regulation, and the development 
of  more accessible tools for those with the greater 
number of legal obligations but who do not have 
the necessary resources. In this way the OHSA 
would 
be 
facilitating 
the 
process 
of 
legal 
compliance at the least possible expense. 
 
4.16  Work and Family Balance 
All government departments will be determining 
their core business hours so that all resources are 
present and accessible during those hours. In this 
way we would not only be guaranteeing a good 
service but also catering for the flexibility necessary 
for a work/family balance, as well as helping to 
reduce traffic congestion. 
 
52 
 
C. Investing in Education and Training 
5.1  
One Tablet per Child 
The study of the pilot project, launched in March 2014, 
made 147 recommendations relative to the implementation 
of this initiative on a national level and the supply of 
tablets to all pupils of Year Four Primary as of October 
2016, as pledged.    The next step is to implement the 
recommendations put forward by the research group, 
amongst which are a call for tenders for the supply of 
tablets, teacher training, the strengthening of the technical 
Internet infrastructure in schools and other administrative 
groundwork for the national project that takes off in 
October 2016. 
 
5.2  
Increasing Stipends  
Student stipends will be increased pro rata to reflect the 
COLA. 
 
5.3  
Stipends for Maturity Clause Students 
Students admitted to read courses under the maturity 
clause will be deemed to be students with full 
requirements when applying for a stipend.  This applies to 
students of both MCAST and the University. 
 
 
53 
 
5.4  
A new ITS 
we shall be embarking on one of the most ambitious 
projects ever undertaken for human resources in tourism 
through the investment of €56 million in the building of a 
new Institute of Tourism Studies in Smart City.   
The new ITS will be catering for the needs of Maltese 
students and workers in the industry, as well as attracting 
foreign students to follow courses in tourism and 
hospitality in Malta. The relocation of the institutes will 
afford a better product for the students and create more 
opportunities. 
A call for tenders will be issued relating to the premises 
currently occupied by the Institute for its development into 
a new project that compliments the surrounding area.   
The possibility of strategic partnerships is already being 
explored 
with 
international 
schools, 
renowned 
in 
hospitality management. 
5.5  
A new Grant for ITS Students 
As of the next academic year and for the first time ever  
Government will be offering a grant of  €233 to every 
student attending the ITS to partially cover the cost of the 
relative educational material.  
5.6  
Barts and the London School of Medicine and 
Dentistry in Gozo 
The English Queen Mary University will be establishing its 
first ever overseas campus in Gozo. The Barts campus in 
Gozo will be opening its doors in September 2016 and will 
be teaching around 300 students over a period of five 
years.  
 
54 
 
5.7  
American University of Malta 
Next year will see the submission of the relative 
applications and consequently the commencement of 
works on the American University of Malta, with its two 
campuses in Cospicua and Marsascala.  This project will 
give a new boost to the south of the country. 
 
5.8  
Training Funds 
Training funds will once again be available through the 
European Social Fund.  Following the success of the 
Training Aid Framework we shall now be launching the 
Investing in Skills initiative.  As was the case in the past 
year, all payments due to employers will be made within a 
few months not years.   
As of next year we will be launching 'Training Pays', a 
scheme intended to encourage more people to train or re-
train and where part of the training will be subsidised. 
 
5.9  
Work Exposure and Traineeships 
For the next seven years the Employment and Training 
Corporation will be offering 500 work exposure and 
traineeship placements every year. This will help to further 
reduce unemployment to record levels in our country.  
5.10  Mariam Al Batool School  
In the coming year a financial allocation will be made to 
the Mariam Al Batool School for the building of another 
floor to accommodate a larger number of students. 
 
55 
 
5.11  New Monitoring Entity for University Services 
The University of Malta will be setting up a new entity to 
monitor the quality of services it offers through each 
department, 
and 
another 
entity 
to 
provide 
a 
comprehensive service to academics as support for 
research. New facilities will be built for Post Doc as well as 
the extension of the Mathematics and Physics buildings.  
5.12  Screening Programme 
A new screening programme will be launched with the 
title of "A Lens on our Children's Development".  The 
programme will monitor children from an early age to 
identify their special needs in good time for them to be 
given the support they require. 
 
5.13  Literacy Programmes 
Government 
will 
be 
strengthening 
the 
bilingual 
programme "Aqra Mieghi/Read with Me", aimed at infants 
and children under three year and their parents/guardians. 
Government will also continue with the programme "Aqra 
Kemm Tiflaħ" (Read as Much As You Can) to further 
emphasize a love of reading among primary and middle 
school children. Each school will be given 100 books, 50 in 
Maltese and 50 in English for every class.  
Also to be strengthen and widened in scope is the 
programme "Nwar". Through this literacy programme it is 
intended to cut down on the waiting list of children 
requesting this service.  
 
56 
 
5.14  Arrangement with the Cambridge University  
Government will be  sustaining the arrangement it has 
reached with Cambridge University to strengthening the 
use of English and will live up to its commitment to 
encourage more children to choose to study languages 
through  more attractive packages as was the case wth the 
SPA programme for Italian which it intends to widen out 
to include French and German.  
 
5.15  Prince’s Trust 
In an effort to offer value added alternatives for students 
who for various reasons fall behind in their studies we 
shall be introducing, in collaboration with HSBC Malta, the 
Prince's Trust aimed at helping these students make 
progress and acquire skills that help them integrate in 
society.  It will be the first time this programme is run 
outside of the United Kingdon and will initially be offered 
in seven state schools. 
 
5.16  ESPLORA 
As part of Government's plan to promote and popularize 
science studies, the ESPLORA Science Centre will be set up 
which will include a programme co-ordinated with 
schools. 
 
5.17  Tools for Teachers 
All teachers of Year Four Primary in all schools (State, 
Church and Independent) will he given a tablet and will 
 
57 
 
continue to receive training in its use. An Authoring Tool 
will also be developed for teachers and three digitial books 
will be launched. 
More interactive whiteboards will be acquired so that each 
class will have one available and a computer will be 
acquired for each interactiveboard. All teacher laptops will 
be replaced and for the first time, laptops will be made 
available to kindergarten assistants and learning support 
assistants. Also to be purchased are 3D scanners and 
printers for Design and Technology laboratories in middle 
and secondary schools.  
 
5.18  New Educational Routes 
The Klabb 3-16 after school programmes will be revised to 
include support in HW and languages, and drama, sports 
and IT programmes. 
A new school will also open in Gzira for 16-year-old 
students who only obtain one SEC certificate at the end of 
their regular schooling.  The new school will offer these 
students a second chance to complete their education and 
eventually receive more training or find a job. These 
students will be given a stipend.  
Government is also committing itself to incrase its 
recurrent expenditure to assist church schools in providing 
vocational courses whilst their teaching staff would benefit 
from conditions of work that are on a par with state school 
staff.  
5.19  National Book Council 
The National Book Council is raising the quality of the 
 
58 
 
National 
Book 
Prize 
to 
give 
more 
prestige 
and 
acknowledgement to Maltese authors and publishers. The 
allocaton for the National Book Fund has also been 
increased. 
 
5.20  Higher Education Regulator 
The allocation for the National Council for Advanced and 
High Education is being increased for it to better fulfil its 
regulatory function in education. 
 
5.21  MCAST 
The MCAST is continuing its structural transformation into 
a Foundation College, a Technical College and a University 
College. The college will further strengthen and widen the 
scope of the apprenticeship scheme whilst introducing new 
forms of work based learning at different levels. Now that 
the first phase of the new campus is finalised, work will 
continue on the second phase of the campus which 
includes the new blocks for the Institute of Engineering 
and Transport, the Library and the Learning Support Unit. 
5.22  Building of Schools and Educational Facilities 
A 
number 
of 
new 
buildings 
and 
infrastructural 
maintenance works are in the pipeline, which include the 
extension of the Wardija centre, the Marsascala football 
pitch, the upper secondary schools in Ħal-Kirkop and Ħad-
Dingli and the conversion of what was formerly the 
Treasury 
Building 
for 
use 
by 
the 
Examinations 
Department.  Next year will also see the start of phase one 
of  the new school in St Paul's Bay and works on the track

Productivity 
and 
Competitiveness 
 
6.1  
Shop Opening Hours 
Now that the public consultation on the White 
Paper relative to shop opening times has come to 
an end, Government will be announcing new 
regulations by the end of this year. In reaching a 
final decision due weight is being given to both 
workers rights and flexibility. 
 
6.2  
Incentives for the Film Industry 
The Film Commission is exploring the possibility 
of investing, jointly with the private sector, in a 
sound stage and related equipment. A call for 
expressions of interest is therefore being made for a 
PPP at the film studios in Kalkara. 
Through a fund set up for this specific purpose, 
local companies are being given new opportunities 
to operate on the international market. The Film 
Commission will continue to promote Malta 
around the world and for this purpose we are 
increasing the allocation for marketing and PR. 
More incentives will target the international film 
industry to further attract them to operating in 
Malta, to generate more jobs in and around this 
industry, as well as to make this industry a regular 
and sustainable source of income. 
 
61 
 
6.3  
Aviation Sector 
The Malta Air Traffic Services (MATS) has 
proceeded with its Air Traffic Management (ATM) 
System Upgrade.  This development, the largest 
and most complex project embarked upon by 
MATS, is expected to be fully commissioned next 
year. Other projects include a new Air Traffic 
Control Centre (ATCC); a new radar to replace the 
one in Dingli as well as a Aeronautical Message 
Handling System which will enable the company 
to modernise its tools and fulfill it's role more 
securely and efficiently. 
 
6.4  
Financial Services 
The financial services sector in our country has 
continued to expand and strengthen.  Now the 
Financial Services Authority is part of the 
European Single Supervisory Mechanism. This will 
continue to give more credibility and further boost 
our financial sector. 
6.5  
Electronic Company Registration 
As of next year the fee payable for  company 
registration for companies with a capital not 
exceeding 1,500 Euros, when such redgistration is 
made electronically,  will be reduced from 250 
Euros to 100 Euros. Through this measure 
Government will be further reducing costs for 
small companies 
 
 
62 
 
6.6  
Malta Stock Exchange 
Over the past two years, the Malta Stock Exchange 
was engaged in an initiative intended to establish a 
new capital market that addresses the needs of 
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in terms of 
financing for their expansion and development. 
This new market will have the structure of a 
Multilateral trading facility intended to provide 
SMEs with opportunities of direct financing by 
investors in the market, in an efficient and 
regulated manner and above all without undue 
expense.  This capital market will also provide the 
neccessary infrastructure for these small companies 
to start considering Succession Planning. 
 
As an operator on the local market, The Malta 
Stock Exchange, together with the Ministry of 
Finance, is engaged in talks through an specifically 
established Committee of Experts, to draw up a 
Road Map for the development of Malta's capital 
market in the coming years, particularly in the 
context of new European regulations and directives 
as well as in the context of the discussions relating 
to a Capital Market Union taking place in the 
European Union at the current time. 
 
Recently, 
the 
Malta 
Stock 
Exchange, 
in 
collaboration with the Ministry of Education, took 
on an initiative to promote financial education in 
Malta. A committee was set up with members from 
the Malta Stock Exchange and the Minister of 
 
63 
 
Education,  together with other experts, to evaluate 
not only the current state of financial education in 
the context of the national curriculum but also to 
organize a series of events aimed at actual and 
potential investors. The first conference for 
investors will be held in the coming days. 
 
64 
 
6.7  
National Development Bank 
Work on this project is at an advanced stage. The 
Bill for the setting up of this bank will be moved in 
Parliament next year. Talks were held with the 
European institutions concerned, including the 
European Commission, to ensure that the National 
Development Bank with be in line with European 
Union directives.  Close consultation was also held 
with the European Investment Bank and other 
foreign 
institutions 
which 
offered 
technical 
assistance in the setting up of this important 
institution. 
 
6.8  
Education Malta 
In the light of the internationalisation of education, 
Education Malta will be set up, on the same lines as 
Malta Enterprise, to promote Malta as an 
educational centre with investors both locally and 
on a European and international level. 
6.9  
Trade Malta Ltd.  
During 2015, Trade Malta was successfully 
engaged in the Trade Mission at the Milan Expo.  
Local enterprises responded to the public call made 
by Trade Malta and these had the opportunity to 
build a network of new contacts with well 
established Italian companies.  At the time of 
writing this budget, preparations were in hand for 
another two missions in important international 
markets - Algeria and Turkey.  Scores of companies 
have responded to these two calls.

stakeholders In the past  weeks  
 
 
6.11  Projects Malta  
In 2016 Projects Malta will continue the work of 
establishing a PPP for the digging of new graves at 
the Addolorata Cemetery.  
 
 
6.12  Infrastructure (Ports) and Merchant Shipping 
During the coming year, Government will continue 
to invest in our ports. 
One could mention the breakwater project at 
Marsamcetto which is currently in the study phase 
but which, once accomplished, would attract more 
investment and economic growth. Government's 
commitment in this sphere is persistent.  
The European Fund for Strategic Investments 
(EFSI), proposed by the Commission as a part of 
the Juncker Investment Plan for Europe, could be a 
source of more sustainable projects which would 
have a positive impact on the economy, the 
environment and society in general. 
The ever rising standards in maritime security and 
 
66 
 
the new methods employed in the management of 
the Maltese flag are giving good results not only in 
the number of vessels registered, but also as 
regards the standing of the companies seeking to 
register their fleets in Malta. This will continue to 
characterise Government's commitment to attract 
renowned and better quality clients.  
Government will also be engaged in ensuring a 
higher level of security in our ports and coastline 
and the protection of the seas and critical 
infrastructure. 
 
67 
 
6.13  Oil and Gas and Mineral Exploration 
In the field of oil exploration, Government is in the 
process of gathering new geophysical data and the 
analysis of seismic data gathered in the past. At the 
same time Government will continue amending 
legislation regulating this sphere and will proceed 
with the initiatives for the digitisation of data 
collected in the past.  
 
 
6.14  Foreign Policy: CHOGM, the Valletta Summit 
and the Presidency of the EU Council 2017 
Works are in hand for the restoration and 
adaptation of the hall, which until recently was the 
chamber of the House of Representatives, to be 
equipped to serve as a venue for informal 
Ministerial talks during the EU Presidency.  
MCAST Arts students have been commissioned to 
design a logo for the Presidency. The logo will be 
revealed towards the end of 2016. 
 
Apart from this, Malta will be hosting two other 
very important meetings in 2015, namely the 
Valletta Summit of European and African heads of 
state 
and 
the 
Commonwealth 
Heads 
of 
Government Meeting, two events which will place 
Malta under the lens of international media. 
 
 
68 
 
6.15  Assistance Schemes for Businesses 
With a view to meeting the expectations of a wider 
spectrum of businesses and companies, Malta 
Enterprise will introduce, by the end of the year, a 
number of schemes to assist businesses. These 
schemes will add up to already launched initiatives 
such as the B-Start, the scheme for the development 
of a Crafts Village in Ta'  Qali and Ta' Dbieġi in 
Gozo, as well as the extension of the Microinvest, 
Investment Aid, Get Qualified, Research & 
Development, 
Certify 
and 
Gozo 
Transport 
schemes. 
6.16  Assistance for the Promotion of Female 
Participation in Entrepreneurship 
With the aim of encouraging more female 
participation in entrepreneurship, the Micro Invest 
scheme will be modified so that self-employed 
women and enterprises where the majority equity 
is controlled by females will be given a maximum 
tax credit of €50,000 instead of €30,000. 
 
 
 
69 
 
6.17  Assistance for knowledge transfer 
Malta Enterprise will be putting into effect an 
assistance scheme to subsidise knowledge transfer 
within enterprises. This is intended to help with 
the transfer of skills from present to new 
employees and for Maltese workers to acquire new 
skills essential in   attracting new business to Malta. 
The assistance will be given in the form of a tax 
credit, however it will also take the shape of a 
financial grant where the project is of significant 
importance in the development of the company. A 
fund of one million Euros will be allocated to cover 
the financial assistance involved in this scheme. 
 
6.18  Assistance 
for 
small 
enterprises 
in 
manufacturing 
Malta Enterprise will be activating incentives for 
small enterprises leasing additional space from the 
private sector for the purposes of manufacturing, 
through which they will be compensated for 
relocation. The aid will be given for a period not 
exceeding two years and to a maximum of €10,000 
per annum. 
6.19  Assistance to Artisans 
The Malta Crafts Council and Malta Enterprise will 
be launching a pilot project intended to train new 
artisans in developing sectors of traditional crafts 
that are in danger of disappearing. This project is 
 
70 
 
estimated to cost one million Euros and will 
provide assistance to craftsmen who are willing to 
pass on their skills to others in a bid to develop a 
training 
programme 
within 
an 
educational 
institution. Aid will also be given to those who put 
the training given to practice and invest in a start-
up in the craft for which training was received.  
 
71 
 
6.20  Encouraging Businesses to Invest more 
In conformity with Government's programme, 
Malta Industiral Parks (MIP) has approved a policy 
whereby businesses leasing property from the MIP 
may apply for a stronger title on the property this 
leased to be in a better position to invest further 
and create more jobs. 
 
6.21  Maritime Hub 
Following the signing of a Memorandum of 
Understanding between the Privitisation Unit and 
the preferred bidder, the concession agreement is 
now being finalised. This project is aimed 
specifically at servicing the oil industry through 
the supply of services related to maintenance and 
logistics amongst many other services.  This 
industrial development offers vast opportunities 
for skilled tradesmen and for apprenticeships 
related to engineering.   
 
6.22  White Rocks Malta 
The White Rock Malta project yielded eleven 
bidders who made it through from the Expression 
of Interest phase to the Request for Proposals stage. 
These same bidders will now be invited by te 
Privatisation Unit to collect the document relating 
to the Request for  Proposals and eventually 
submit their final proposals which must include 
the building of a Five Star hotel or higher, apart 
from other facilities and amenities capable of 
 
72 
 
attracting quality tourists. 
The Faculty of Architecture of the University of 
Malta has been assigned the role of advising about 
the various environmental aspects of this project, 
including a recommendation regarding the best 
use of the land allocated for this project. Only 30% 
of the land allocated for the project will be 
developed, which  development must abide by the 
principles of Natura 2000; the rest of the land will 
be dedicated to gardens and various types of  
landscaping.  These open spaces must be accessible 
to the general public. 
 
73 
 
6.23  Crafts Village in Ta' Qali 
After more than 20 years, works will finally start 
on the project of a Crafts Village in Ta' Qali.  This 
follows the submission by Malta Industrial Parks of 
the application for European funding for this 
project. 
 
6.24  Three new Hangars at the Safi Aviation Park 
The infrastructure for the aviation industry will be 
enhanced with the building of 3 new hangars in the 
Safi Aviation Park and works will also be carried 
out by a foreign company on the building of 
another hangar to be used for aircraft spray 
painting. 
 
6.25  Upgrading of Industrial Estates 
Whilst continuing to render Malta Industrial Parks 
more sustainable, maintenance work and other 
investments will be carried out in the various 
industrial estates. By July of this year the MIP had 
already invested more than €2 million in the 
industrial estates, which amount will have reached 
€3.5 million by the end of this year.  Works will be 
carried out on roads leading to industrial zones, 
including the one leading to the Mosta Industrial 
Estate which is in a state of total neglect and has 
become a rubbish dump.  
 
 
74 
 
6.26  Family Business Legislation 
In conformity with Government's programme, the 
studies and proposals for the introduction of 
legislation regulating Family businesses were 
finalised this year.  These legal proposals together 
with incentives for improved business governance, 
as well as fiscal incentives rendering the transfer of 
business 
between 
family 
members 
more 
sustainable, were approved by Cabinet and in the 
coming weeks a White Paper will be published for 
public consultation prior to the formulation of a 
Bill to be presented in Parliament. 
 
6.27  Social Entrepreneurship Act 
In pursuance of Government's programme to 
address the needs of our society and at the same 
time contribute to more economic growth, a social 
entrepreneurship Bill was finalised this year. 
Following the publication of a White Paper for 
public consultation, the Bill will now be revised on 
the basis of the submissions made by the public, 
and in the coming months the Bill will be moved in 
the House of Representatives. 
 
6.28  Life Sciences Park 
The Life Sciences Park in San Ġwann will be 
hosting its first enterprises by the end of this year. 
At the same time, whilst infrastructural works 
were going on in this project, these facilities were 
also being promoted with local and foreign 
 
75 
 
investors in this field. As a result of this campaign, 
Malta Enterprise is in the process of signing a 
number of contracts with companies to start 
operating from this complex. 
 
76 
 
6.29  Digital Hub 
Similarly, a promotional campaign was conducted 
with companies operating in the field of IT, 
particularly with companies whose products relate 
to Life Sciences and the facilities offered by the 
Digital Hub.  A number of projects with foreign 
financing were attracted, which enterprises are 
now negotiating the final contract for them to start 
operating from the Digital Hub. 
 
6.30  Logistics policy  
Malta Enterprise in finalising the drafting of a 
holistic logistics policy intended to transform Malta 
into a 
logistic hub 
in the 
centre 
of 
the 
Mediterranean. 
Meantime, 
a 
number 
of 
amendments to the legislation regulating the 
promotion of enterprise have already been 
presented so that companies operating in this field 
could benefit from various incentives. 
 
 
6.31  Renewal of Insolvency Legislation 
A group was set up to revise insolvency legislation 
with the aim of rendering procedures relating to 
bankruptcy 
more 
efficient 
and 
transparent. 
Proposals by this group are expected in the coming 
month, when the process of legislation reform 
could start and the institutions concerned be 
equipped with the necessary resources.  
 
77 
 
6.32  Assistance for Start-Ups 
Following the launch this year of the B-Start 
scheme, aimed at offering assistance to start-ups, in 
the coming days Malta Enterprise will be 
launching another assistance scheme for new start-
up companies.   The scheme will take the shape of 
grants to be paid back to the corporation over a 
period of 10 years.  
This 
programme 
will 
be 
offering 
financial 
assistance of up to €200,000, pari passu with private 
equity. In the case of innovative enterprises 
developing new products, processes or services of 
a level higher than what already obtains in the 
industry, the assistance given could reach €500,000 
and will be earmarked for the purchase of 
equipment. Assistance could also be given to 
companies attempting to generate capital through 
crowd funding. 
6.33  Export Credit Guarantee Scheme 
Government will be engaged in establishing a 
structure guaranteeing export credit for non 
commercial risk. This is necessary to assist exports 
to less developed zones where the risk is much 
more pronounced. 
6.34  Maritime Malta 
The promotional work carried out by Maritime 
Malta for the local sector will be further enhanced 
with a larger Government allocation for this year 
amounting to €350,000. 
 
78 
 
6.35  Mrieħel Masterplan 
A Foundation will be set up between Government 
and the private sector with the aim of improving 
the environment in which businesses at Mrieħel 
operate.  This will take the shape of a Masterplan 
intended to give a new appearance to what is today 
known as the Imrieħel Industrial Zone, from one of 
neglect to that of an organized business and 
commercial 
hub 
capable 
of 
attracting 
new 
investment in the area. 
6.36  Incentives for Research and Innovation 
To better facilitate research and innovation, 
enterprises that employ persons in possession of a 
doctorate or are in the course of reading for a 
doctorate in science, information technology or 
engineering will be given a fiscal credit of up to a 
maximum of €10,000 when such employment is 
held for more than 12 months.  
Through the programmes run by MCST we will 
continue to give incentives for research and 
innovation with programmes such as Fusion which 
complements EU funds under the Horizon 2020 
programme and which the research community is 
succeeding in attracting despite harsh competition 
in this field.  
 
79 
 
6.37  European funds for Start-ups and Family 
Businesses 
Through a number of schemes to be launched in 
the coming months we shall be investing around 
€50 million that will serve as an injection for all 
those wishing to invest or expand their industry. 
These €50 million will take the shape of grants. 
Apart from these grants there are also over €300 
billion available as loans obtainable under the 
European Investment Plan. 
These funds will be spread out over a number of 
initiatives and will help various bands of Maltese 
industry. 
Featuring 
also 
among 
potential 
beneficiaries are family-owned businesses as well 
as start-ups.  Innovative initiatives will also benefit 
from specific schemes. General investments -
including purchase of equipment and machinery - 
are also expected to benefit from the schemes to be 
announced in the coming months. 
 
6.38  Reform of the Farmers' Wholesale Market 
In the coming year we shall be investing heavily in 
the acquisition of produce crates with an electronic 
chip, capable of providing clear tracing of any 
particular crate.  A public call will also be made 
leading to the modernization of structures and 
equipment with the involvement of the private 
sector.  It is envisaged that this process would be 
rolled out over a number of years. 
 
80 
 
6.39  Public Abattoir 
Without hindering production at the Abattoir, the 
renovation programme will continue with the 
restoration of the old structures that form part of 
the abattoir complex, including the replacement of 
asbestos ceilings and other insulation work. During 
the coming year works will also be carried out on 
temperture control systems to ensure adequate 
tempertures in line with slaughtering regulations, 
as well as the completion of the extensive 
renovation on the slaughter lines themsleves. 
 
6.40  Fisheries and Aquaculture 
To bring all fisheries related operations in line with 
European Union directives new systems are being 
installed for the weighing of fish immediately upon 
landing. This new system will also be used in the 
new wholesale fish market which is expected to be 
fully operational by the end of the lampuki season. 
On the other hand, works on the upper floor of the 
new fish market will continue during 2016, and 
these will include a fish processing plant. 
In the field of aquaculture, preliminary studies are 
in hand for the development of an offshore 
aquaculture that would sustainable in the future. 
Other positive developments in the fishing sector 
include the successful negotiation of a new 
agreement regarding quotas for tuna landing 
whereby Malta's quota was increased. Other 
negotiations 
aim 
for 
a 
standardization 
of 
 
81 
 
regulations equally applicable to both European 
and North African fishermen. 
Work will also continue in the coming year on a 
marine hatchery with the participation of the 
private sector. 
 
6.41  A Breakwater for Marsaxlokk Fishermen 
As 
pledged 
in 
the 
Electoral 
Programme, 
Government has once again revived the process, 
that had been almost completely abandoned, for 
the acquisition of the necessary permits for the 
development of a new breakwater for Marsaxlokk 
fishermen, as well as the repair and  improvement 
of the already existing one. 
In relation to this project long discussions were 
held with the European Union Commission which 
led to the acknowledgement by the same 
Commission of the necessity of the project. As a 
result of these talks the Commission agreed to 
allocate around €8 million under the European 
Maritime and Fisheries Fund of the global sum 
needed for this whole project. 
 
 
82 
 
E. Investing in the Environment and in Health 
7.1  
Environment 
In 2016 we shall continue with specific initiatives in this 
field, including the conservation of a number of sites of 
natural importance through special agreements with 
various environmental NGOs. We also intend to roll out 
a series of management plans on Natura 2000 sites.  The 
updating and strengthening of a new environmental 
policy will also be taken in hand.    
During 2016,  the development of a strategy and plan of 
action for a Green Economy will be finalised and 
approved by Cabinet for its implementation over a 
number of years. This includes a list of actions to promote 
investment and economic growth; education; job creation 
and the sustainability of resources in various other 
aspects of the economy including waste, water, energy, 
transport, tourism, agriculture, the construction industry 
and manufacturing.  
Meanwhile, in an effort to improve the environment, we 
shall be embarking on a programme of seawater 
monitoring with the aim of better protecting the 
environment of the sea  
 
7.2  
Rural Infrastructure: Cleaning and Embellishment 
Various initiatives and projects are concentrating on 
historic villages and towns like the City of Valletta, 
Mdina, and the Three Cities (Cottonera) to complement 
Government's rehabilitation plan.  These works will be 
intensified, and extensive projects are planned for 
 
83 
 
Floriana and the open spaces surrounding Valletta which 
include the restoration of the Tritons Fountain, and the 
Argotti Botanical Garden. 
Government is committed to support the "Għalfejn 
Tħammeġ Pajjiżek? (Why litter your country?) campaign 
which continues to attract much interest, as well as to 
address 
the 
cleansing 
of 
beaches, 
tourist 
zones, 
recreational areas, and rural and urban landscapes.  The 
nationwide refurbishment programme will continue with 
the embellishment of streets, central strips, roundabouts 
and public plazas.  
Government is in the process of drafting an Integrated 
National Plan for the Embellishment and Protection of 
Valleys. The next step is for Government to invest in  a 
serious and well-planned programme with the help of a 
team of experts. Our valleys have an important 
hydrological function and thus funds will be requested 
under the Operative Programme 2014-2020.  
The Carnival Village project is soon to commence in 
Marsa which will mean that the operations of the 
Department for Manufacture and Services will be moved 
to Corradino. 
 
 
84 
 
7.3  
The Role of tourism in nature and biodiversity 
We are actively exploring the possibility of networks to 
attract quality tourism to Malta. In this context, the 
natural capital of Malta is abundant and therefore there 
exist opportunities to increase the economic value added 
through infrastructure in the eco-tourism market. 
7.4  
A National Park in the South of Malta 
Works will soon start on the development of a new park 
in the south of Malta. This will stretch along the coast 
between Żonqor Point in Marsascala and Blata l-Bajda in 
Xgħajra. For this purpose, the Office of the Prime Minister 
has set up a committee in collaboration with the Ministry 
for the Environment and the participation of other 
experts to draft a plan of implementation. This project is 
expected to commence in the course of next year. 
 
7.5  
Consultation about Food Wastage 
The debate is ongoing throughout Europe regarding the 
amount of food that is thrown away, particularly by large 
establishments like supermarkets. A number of countries 
are introducing legislation in this context for such food to 
be put to better use. Government will be examining best 
practices and will organize a process of public 
consultation to establish whether the need exists for such 
legislation and if in the affirmative, what form it should 
take. 
 
 
85 
 
7.6  
Creation of the Environment and Resources 
Authority 
The strategic demerger within MEPA will take effect with 
the creation of the Environment and Resources Authority 
as soon as the legislation moved in the course of 2015 is 
approved by Parliament. Government is committed to see 
that this new Authority would have all the necessary 
human and financial resources to truly be in a position to 
safeguard the Maltese environment in the best possible 
way. For the first year the Authority will have a budget of 
€8 million. 
 
7.7  
Climate Change 
Following the introduction in 2015 of legislation for 
action against climate change, 2016 must see the building 
of the structures contemplated in the same legislation, 
namely the Climate Action Board and the Climate Fund, 
to make sure that our country meets the challenges of 
climate change, including international obligations in this 
regard.  Meanwhile,  it is anticipated that the first Low 
Carbon Development Strategy will be in place and  
national guidelines established relating to the reduction 
of greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time and in this 
same context the necessary funds will be allocated for our 
country to fulfil its international climate finance 
obligations. These include direct grants and scholarships.  
It is also anticipated that a final decision regarding 
legislation relating to noise pollution will be taken during 
2016.

7.8  
Dual Fuel 
We are allocating €100,000 for the introduction of a new 
scheme for  commercial  and passenger transport vehicles 
of types N2, N3, M2 and M3, where a grant of €700 will 
be given for conversion to Euro5 and Euro6a.  This 
conversion incorporates a system known as Dual Diesel 
Fuel, which uses diesel and LPG simultaneously. The 
expense involved in the conversion of each vehicle 
amounts to approximately €3,000.  This scheme will come 
into force on 1st January 2016. 
7.9  
Scrappage Scheme 
Government will once again allocate funds for the 
scrapping of old cars and cars with high emissions. 
Through this scheme, Government will give grants 
whenever a car of over 10 years is scrapped and replaced 
by a new car. To encourage the use of small and less 
polluting vehicles a grant of €7,000 will be given towards 
the purchase of a new electric vehicle when the old 
vehicle is scrapped; a grant of €4,000 on the purchase of 
an electric vehicle when no old vehicle is  scrapped and 
€2,000 towards the purchase of an electric quadricycle. In 
the case of passenger vehicles, a grant of €2,000 will be 
given for hybrid vehicles with carbon dioxide emissions 
of between 50 and 65g/km; €3,000 for each plug-in  hybrid 
electric vehicle with carbon dioxide emissions of between 
1 and 50g/km; €900 towards the purchase of vehicles with 
carbon dioxide emissions not exceeding 100g/km and 
€700 in the case of new vehicles with carbon dioxide 
emissions of between 101g/km and 130g/km. These 
schemes will come into effect as of 1st January 2016. 
 
87 
 
7.10  Measures relating to electric vehicles for businesses 
In addition to the schemes for the scrapping of old cars 
and their replacement with less  polluting electric 
vehicles, we shall also be assisting importers of new cars 
in investing in the necessary equipment and training for 
the maintenance of electric vehicles. This scheme will be 
limited and will only be made available on a first come 
first serve basis. Together with this scheme we shall be 
assisting businesses in the installation of charging points 
for electric vehicles. The allocation for these schemes will 
be of €100,000.  These schemes are effective 1st January 
2016. 
7.11  Autogas 
The autogas scheme whereby a grant of €200 was given 
for conversion of vehicles of types M1 and N1 is being 
extended for the year 2016.  The allocation for this 
scheme, which comes into effect on 1st January 2016, is of 
€50,000. 
7.12  Installation of Cameras 
ANPR cameras (a system of number plate recognition) 
will be installed in strategic places for the better control of 
vehicles in arrears on annual road licences and well as 
vehicles with foreign number plates.  This project has an 
allocation of €100,000. 
 
88 
 
7.13  VRT 
In order to encourage the use of newer, less polluting 
cars, type M1 and N1 vehicles with a mileage of over 
160,000 kilometers will be submitted to VRT testing every 
year instead of every two years. This measure 
corresponds to the VRT Directive. 
7.14  Measures related to small motorcycles 
In 2016 we will be encouraging more people to choose 
small motorcycles in place of cars, with a view to easing 
the pressure of congestion on the roads whilst going 
some way in alleviating the parking problem. For this 
purpose, and for this year (2016) only, road licences for 
small motorcycles of 125cc will be drastically reduced to a 
nominal €10 per annum. We are also removing all 
registration tax on electric motorcycles. This measure is 
effective 1st January 2016. 
In addition, and to further discourage the use of cars, 
motorcycles of 125cc or less may be driven by any person 
over 18 years who is in possession of a category B driving 
licence. Whilst doing this we shall be emphasising more 
discipline and attention on the roads. This is because if 
these measures are successful, whilst easing the traffic 
problem, it will also give rise to a new phenomenon on 
our roads that drivers and pedestrians alike need to be 
made aware of. For this purpose Transport Malta will be 
launching a campaign which focuses on road safety. 
 
89 
 
7.15  Tax rebates for Companies investing in Electric 
Vehicles 
To date, companies investing in electric vehicles 
benefitted from a tax rebate equivalent to 125% of outlay, 
taken against income for year of purchase. We are 
proposing to raise this tax rebate to 150% of the cost of 
vehicles with no carbon dioxide emissions, that is 0g/Km.  
Hybrid vehicles with emissions of up to 70g/Km will 
benefit from a tax rebate of 125%. This measure comes 
into effect on 1st January 2016. 
7.16  Green Public Procurement 
Government will maintain its policy of green public 
procurement in public administration so that products 
and 
services 
purchased 
would 
be 
of 
a 
higher 
environmental standard. For this reason the procedure of 
green 
public 
procurement 
is 
being 
simplified. 
Furthermore groundwork will continue next year on the 
formulation of the second national plan in this sector. 
 
7.17  Waste Management 
Work will continue in 2016 on the implementation of a 
waste management plan.  Following the call for tenders 
during 2015, a waste management education campaign 
spanning three years will be launched in 2016. 
By the end of this year we shall have activated a pilot 
project in five localities for the use of a third refuse bag -  
the white bag for organic waste.  The plan is for this 
initiative to be spread wider during 2016.  In the same 
way, in full consultation with constituted bodies and 
 
90 
 
stakeholders in the field, other initiatives are being 
considered for a more effective regulation of commercial 
waste. WastServe will also launch the reform in battery 
and accumulator collection as provided in the National 
Waste Management Plan. 
In the coming weeks we will be issuing a call for 
proposals for the collection of waste plastic bottles and 
metal cans used for beverages with a view to indentifying 
the best procedure for the collection of this type of waste 
by the first half of the coming year.  
Meanwhile the study regarding waste-to-energy is 
expected to be completed during the final months of this 
year. Next year preliminary work for the implementation 
of this plan will commence after Government decides 
whether we should proceed with the construction of  a 
waste-to-energy plant or whether to export this waste, or 
a combination of both. 
 
91 
 
7.18  WasteServ 
In the coming year WasteServ will continue with its 
intensive commitment to enhance the efficiency of the 
plants it operates. Another challenge in the coming year 
would be the scheme for the collection of spent car 
batteries by private entities.  WasteServ will also continue 
working on the fulfilment of the national waste 
management plan which includes, amongst other things,  
the restructuring of Civic Amenities with a view to 
identifying the best way to involve private  interests in 
the running of these sites. 
7.19  Parks and Afforestation 
Works were started in 2015 on the embellishment of 
Kennedy Grove and these are expected to be completed 
by the end of the year. Works were also started on the 
new park in Żabbar Ditch where the cleaning and 
pruning has been completed. These works will continue 
through 2016 and in connection with this development 
the financial support of a commercial bank has been 
secured. 
In addition to this, the programme of afforestation was 
extended to another five localities: four in Malta and one 
in Gozo,  in 2015. Thus, over the period of two years, the 
number of localities benefitting from this project went up 
to nine.  We plan to transform this initiative into a 
national plan to be implemented over a number of years 
and to reach all towns and villages in Malta and Gozo. 
Against this background, the Parks Directorate will be 
completing its operational review so that apart from 
formulating a new vision, it would also secure adequate 
 
92 
 
resources and new investments for its operations. 
2016 will also see the start of a project, headed by the 
Ministry for Infrastructure, which will involve the 
renovation and conversion of the Floriana botanical 
garden, as well as other neighbouring gardens, into an 
open recreational and environmental centre. 
Once this same Ministry completes the Salini saltpans 
restoration project, it is planned to hand over the saltpans 
and surrounding marshlands to one of the enviromental 
NGOs for their conversion into one of Malta's largest bird 
sanctuaries. 
 
93 
 
7.20  Public Domain 
Government is currently examining the bill, moved but 
the Opposition, regarding public domain, about which a 
study had been commissioned but not acted upon. 
Government intends to present its own amendments and 
then move the bill for debate. 
7.21  Veterinary and Phytosanitary Services 
As part of the process of simplification, certain parts of 
the National Livestock Database will be made accessible 
to officers in other Ministries whilst there will be a point 
of reference so that all requests made would be referred 
directly to the persons concerned. A similar co-ordination 
between respective entities is being formulated also on a 
European level where better integration is planned 
through a common IT system. 
The Plant Health Directorate this year launched its  
research programme about plant pests and diseases, a 
programme that  is co-financed  by the European Union. 
The total cost of this project amounts to €170,267. The aim 
of this research programme is the timely identification of 
pests permitting immediate action for their eradication. 
This project will continue during 2016. 
 
94 
 
7.22  Animal Welfare 
The office of the Commissioner for Animal Welfare will 
be reinforced in the coming years with the provision of 
adequate resources placing this office in a position to 
operate autonomously. 
During the coming year work will continue on the project 
for the setting up of an animal cemetery with the 
participation of the private sector. 
7.23  Marsaxlokk Regeneration Project 
The holistic plan governing this project will be sectioned 
into various phases. The first phase will focus on the 
village centre, with the aim of transforming Xatt is-
Sajjieda (Fishermen's Wharf) and the surrounding areas 
into a pedestrian zone. This will make the area more 
attractive and secure.  
In addition, there will be more investment in the areas 
surrounding Marsaxlokk with works on road networks 
connected various parts of the village to improve traffic 
flow. 
7.24  Rehabilitation of Qajjenza 
Once Enemalta took over this site, a surveillance exercise 
was immediately carried out to ensure the site was safe 
and totally secured. Since then this same site has been 
rendered safe and free of any danger for anyone 
attempting to access it. 
At the current time, Enemalta is evaluating various 
options regarding this site. 
 
95 
 
7.25  The Pace Grasso Regeneration Project 
Government is in the process of planning and laying the 
groundwork for the regeneration of the site currently 
occupied by the Pace Grasso football ground in Paola. 
Following MEPA's completion of the master plan for this 
region, an application was filed by the Ministry of Health 
for the building of a regional Health Hub. The Ministry 
for the Family and Social Solidarity is drafting plans for a 
family resource centre in another part of the site as well 
as a residential centre in the community for persons with 
disability (priority centre). Half of the site currently 
occupied by the Pace Grasso football ground will be 
converted into open and recreational spaces with 
commercial and car parking facilities.  
7.26  Embellishment Projects 
The Foundation for Tourism Zone Development will be 
embarking on two projects for the upgrade of squares 
and plazas in the north and south of Malta.  This will 
involve 
aesthetic 
improvement 
with 
paving 
refurbishment, additional street furniture as well as the 
installation of environmentally sustainable lighting in 
squares in Bugibba and Marsascala. The Foundation for 
Tourism Zone Development has identified the old 
Railway Station garden in Birkirkara, which is part of 
Maltese 
heritage, 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
embellishment projects for a more pleasant experience for 
visitors to our islands.  This includes infrastructural and 
maintenance works, improved access and facilities such 
as benches, and a modern lighting system. The project 
also includes a permanent exhibition about the history of 
the railway in Malta. 
 
96 
 
7.27  Coastal Development 
Project works are currently under way on a new perched 
beach in Xemxija. Once the Environmental Impact 
Assessment is completed it is expected that MEPA will 
finalise its evaluation process as well as indentify the best 
source of sand for the beach.  
7.28  Beach Management and Accessibility 
As of next year, the Malta Tourism Authority will be 
looking to expanding its management mandate to  more 
beaches and to extend the Blue Flag season by another 
month from 1st June to 31st September.  Security services 
in Comino will start even earlier , on 15 May.  The Malta 
Tourism Authority is also planning to improve access and 
facilities for persons with disability and the elderly in a 
number of beaches.  
7.29  Comino 
The Malta Tourism Authority, together with other 
agencies like the Gozo Ministry, Transport Malta, the 
Lands Department, MEPA and others, will continue to 
tend the Blue Lagoon and Santa Maria beaches, where the 
lifeguards season will be extended to ensure the safety of 
visitors even in those days and weeks not considered 
peak season. The Authority's intention is to go beyond 
beaches and to draft a holistic vision for Comino as a Park 
not just a set of beaches.  
 
97 
 
7.30  Task Force for Valletta 
A task force has been set up to address the neglect in 
certain parts of Valletta and to carry out maintenance 
works of a higher level. These include infrastructural 
works as well as the replacement of various road signs. 
After several meetings an area of Marsamcetto has been 
identified where street benches, paving and road signs 
will be upgraded. 
 
7.31  Balconies at City Gate 
A scheme will be launched for the upkeep and repair of 
balconies and apertures overlooking St John's Cavalier 
and Ordinance Street.  
 
7.32  Building Regulation and Sustainable Infrastructure 
The Building Regulation Office in 2015 undertook the 
reinforcement, among other things, of the Construction 
Site Management Regulations with the implementation of 
Legal Notice 295/2007 which saw a greater degree of 
discipline on construction sites. 
The target for 2016 is for this Office to see the publication 
of a new Legal Notice enabling it to be more effective in 
the enforcement of obligations concerning third party 
rights.  
Government is committed to see not only that such 
regulation becomes an intrinsic part of our infrastructural 
system but also to effect more enforcement so that our 
buildings and constructions reach the highest standards 
 
98 
 
of efficiency. 
Government is also committed to seek adequate control 
of construction works in tourist zones during peak 
periods. 
7.33  The Valletta Monti 
Whilst in the process of relocating the Valletta Monti we 
heeded all the views publically expressed. We also 
listened to the Monti hawkers themselves. Note was 
taken of what was said by Renzo Piano, who favoured a 
market on Ordinance Street.  However, it was not 
possible to relocate the whole of the Monti market in half 
the space originally planned and we are considering 
other solutions. Whatever these solutions may be, we are 
determined to introduce an new management system 
enforcing discipline and cleanliness. 
 
7.34  Relocation of the Marsaxlokk Open Market 
Government is assisting in the finding of a just and 
effective solution in this regard so that the project for the 
regeneration of Marsaxlokk might reach its intended 
purpose in the interest of residents and the commercial 
community which includes a large number of hawkers 
who make their living from the Sunday open market 
which has operated there for scores of years and which is 
now synonymous with the locality. 
 
 
 
99 
 
Health 
 
 
7.35  Medicines Authority 
In the coming year a programme of more training, 
study support opportunities as well as an extension of 
the traineeship programme is envisaged for the further 
development of this sector. We shall continue to build 
on the good results of the past two years and increase 
study support opportunities  from the 10% registered  
in 2013 to 70% in 2015. Information technology 
systems will be upgraded for a better service to the 
Authority's clients. 
 
7.36  Laboratories 
The project for the upgrade of national laboratories 
will continue.  This should lead not only to these 
laboratories to acquiring the necessary accreditation 
but also to better quality control in line with European 
standards. For this purpose a network of laboratories 
in Malta will be set up next year for a better co-
ordination between the various laboratories and the 
elimination of duplication of services where these are 
not justified. Several rounds of talks have already been 
held successfully between the various entities in this 
sector and there is strong interest in this modern and 
innovative concept of a laboratory network. 
 
 
100 
 
We plan to set up state of the art science laboratories 
with the opening of sophisticated laboratories in the 
DNA and toxicology divisions of forensics and other 
related sectors.  
It is anticipated that during the course of 2016 these 
laboratories would be run on sustainable business 
lines. 
 
101 
 
7.37  National Health Systems Strategy 
The activity in the health sector in 2016 will focus on 
matters that effect the daily lives of many persons and 
patients and all those engaged in the health sector. 
 
7.38  Listi ta’ stennijja għall-Operazzjonijiet 
Waiting lists for various kinds of surgeries and 
interventions have grown considerably shorter and in 
2016 we shall be focusing on making them even short.   
As an example, waiting times for MRIs were reduced 
from one and a half years as they were in 2013 to three 
months. In the case of cataract operations, the waiting 
time of three years obtaining in 2013 was reduced to 
six months. Substantial reductions were also achieved 
in 
the 
waiting 
lists 
for 
sleep 
studies, 
EMG, 
Echocardiograms, bone density scans and angiograms.  
Through agreements with private clinics we are also 
reducing waiting times for ENT operations as well as 
vein interventions and other day case surgeries.  
This year we will consolidate these initiatives and we 
shall be pushing for a major reduction in waiting times 
for hip and knee replacements. This will ensure better 
quality of life for a large number of people and will be 
implemented through PPP agreements. 
 
7.39  Beds 
The new block at Mater Dei will accommodate 68 new 
beds. This is an important achievement but it is still 
not enough.  Government is therefore committed to 
 
102 
 
launch a new project to build more floors so that this 
new block would offer 300 beds. Plans for this are at 
advanced stage. In 2016 we shall continue to introduce 
new systems of bed management at Mater Dei to make 
the most efficient use of the space available in this 
hospital. 
In addition to this, Karen Grech hospital at St Luke's 
will be redeveloped into a 320 bed hospital for the 
elderly. A new rehabilitation hospital will also be 
developed, offering facilities that currently do not exist 
in Malta. 80 rehabilitation beds will be allocated to the 
Maltese Government.  We shall also be developing an 
new dermatology centre with 12 inpatient beds.  In 
addition, St Luke's Hospital will be also house facilities 
for medical tourism.  This project will be creating 1,000 
new jobs.  In the coming months there will be further 
consultations with all the stakeholders regarding this 
important transition.  
 
103 
 
7.40  Out of Stock Medicines 
We have successfully tackled the problem of out of 
stock 
medicines 
and 
will 
continue 
with 
our 
endeavours to make sure that the 138,00 persons 
eligible for the Pharmacy Of Your Choice scheme 
always find what they require when they go to their 
pharmacy.  
We shall continue working  with the operators of the 
POYC scheme and their representatives to introduce  
service level agreements regarding the services offered 
and to launch a pilot project for the home delivery of 
medicines.  
 
7.41  A&E Department 
We have already achieved a dramatic reduction of 
waiting times at the Accident and Emergency 
Department from 13 to 4 hours in 90% of cases. in 2016 
we shall also be offering a dedicated Paediatric 
Emergency service which will offer a more congenial 
environment for children. 
 
7.42  Distribution of Medicines in Hospital 
We are working on an overhaul of the system of 
distribution of medicines in hospital.  This should 
result in considerable financial savings with the 
minimisation of waste and greater efficiency. This 
would also lead to a better use of human resources 
from what obtains today. 
 
104 
 
7.43  Primary Care 
Throughout this year more primary care services were 
introduced, such as specialised clinics. 
Moreover, the age of persons eligible for breast 
screening was extended and this service is now 
available to all women aged fifty years and over. 
7.44  Kirkop Health Centre 
With the participation of private interests, Government 
will be transforming the building now used as a local 
health clinic in Kirkop into a modern health centre 
offering a wide variety of services to out-patients. 
Mental Health Services 
A Board for Directors, dedicated to Mental Health 
Services, will be appointed. In addition, a whole plan 
will be implemented at Mount Carmel Hospital for the 
upgrade of services. 
7.45  Quality 
This year we saw the completion of one of the biggest 
investments in the health sector in recent years.  The 
Sir Anthony Mamo Oncology Centre, financed by the 
European Regional Development Fund, has just 
received its first patients who are finally making use of 
the beds in this Centre which offers more comfortable 
surroundings  and the latest advanced equipment for 
the best cancer treatment possible. Government also 
intends to add to  the legislative instruments for the 
protection of the citizen.  These include a Charter of 
Patients Rights and legislation governing Organ 
Donation. 
 
105 
 
7.46  Access 
Talks are in progress with private family doctors with 
a view to enhancing their role in the health service and 
with local councils for the latter to take over the 
administration of local health clinics. An application 
was filed with the European Regional Development 
Fund for the building of a Regional Health Centre in 
Paola which will offer services normally only found in 
the general hospital or the Outpatients Department, 
making such services more accessible to communities 
in the Grand Harbour area. 
7.47  IVF 
We shall continue the public debate regarding the 
amendment of IVF legislation, a topic which we notice 
is attracting a wide interest.  In addition, IVF treatment 
will be made accessible to other categories of persons 
apart from couples. 
7.48  Diabetes 
By the end of this year we would have added new 
medications to the government list of free medicines, 
including new medications for diabetes, a disease that 
kills 10% of our population. 
7.49  Cervical Cancer 
Having this year completed the logistic groundwork, 
invitations are being sent out for cervical screening in 
an effort to  minimise the risk of cervical cancer for 
women in Malta and Gozo 
 
106 
 
7.50  Rare Diseases 
We are committed to implement a system which will 
provode 
patients 
with 
rare 
diseases 
with 
the 
medication they need for their treatment, which 
medication tends to be very expensive. We shall 
endeavour to do this in collaboration with our partners 
in the industry both in Malta and in Europe.  
7.51  Other Measures 
Other new initiatives to be introduced next year will 
include a Mobile Sexual Health Unit, a Diabetes policy, 
A National Cancer Plan, research into Obesity, the 
drafting of a Charter of Patients Rights and legislation 
governing Organ Donation. 
As pledged in our electoral programme, we are also 
working 
on 
the 
introduction 
of 
services 
for 
transgender persons who feel the need of a surgical 
sex change for this to be compatible with their gender 
identity. 
 
 
107 
 
F: Reforming and Investing in Priority Sectors  
8.1  
Traffic 
The issue of traffic is on Government's Agenda.  
Since the year 2000 to date, traffic in the country 
has practically doubled. In the past two and a half 
years, an average of 40 new vehicles were 
registered every day, and these vehicles are using 
our roads. 
Although traffic had been on the increase for some 
time, the past years witnessed a number of factors 
that accelerated the rhythm, amongst which, the 
larger number of gainfully occupied, new private 
projects and new road works.  
 
8.2  
Infrastructural Projects 
Government is working on a plan to prioritise 
infrastructural projects. The Coast Road project 
was the one to keep closest to the projected 
schedule.  There is still a lot more to be done to 
improve project management, which formerly was 
next to non-existent. In the same way, there is need 
for more co-ordination between various entities 
like Transport Malta, Enemalta and the Water 
Services Corporation. 
 
Government has consciously decided not to give 
the go ahead to more than one major project at any 
one time, in order to minimise inconvenience to 
commuters. The next project to be taken in hand 
 
108 
 
during the coming year when all preparatory work 
is finalised will be the Kappara Junction.  This will 
be followed by Marsa Road.  Obviously, the works 
at Kappara will create inconvenience and extensive 
works will need to be carried out to provide 
alternative routes. But we know that at the end of 
the day this project will be beneficial and will 
improve traffic circulation, although during the 24 
months it will take to finish the project there will be 
some problems. Transport Malta will try to reach a 
balance between speeding up work by requiring 
contractors to carry out works even during the 
night and not creating too much inconvenience for 
residents of the surrounding areas.  
 
109 
 
8.3  
New Roads 
Transport Malta will be spending €13 million on 
road building and repair. This will include work on 
Vjal ix-Xarolla in Żurrieq, and works in Triq Patri 
Pelaġju and Triq Anthony Aquilina in Ħaż-
Zebbuġ.  
8.4  
Public Private Partnership in Roads Sector 
We believe the private sector, with its enormous 
potential, 
could 
contribute 
more 
in 
the 
development of road infrastructure. Transport 
Malta is collaborating with Projects Malta on the 
planning of various Public-Private Partnerships as 
well as the launching of an ambitious programme 
in this sector. This model, which will not place any 
new burdens on commuters, will be launched in 
the coming months. 
8.5  
Tidal System and Smart Traffic Management 
System 
On a number of roads we will be testing out the 
introduction of the tidal system, meaning that three 
out of every four lanes will be used for the 
direction with heaviest traffic according to the time 
of day.  
We are in the final phase of adjudication of the 
Smart Traffic Management System, which will 
monitor 
traffic 
through 
strategically 
placed 
cameras, send text messages to commuters and 
help to control the situation at any given time.  
 
 
110 
 
8.6  
Horses and Trucks on the Road 
The consultation regardnig the use of trucks and 
horses on our roads has been concluded and 
decisions will be made public shortly. 
8.7  
Public Transport 
The Public Transport System is a work in progress. 
Undoubtedly there has been an improvement over 
what obtained previously, but we are not yet 
satisfied. We will be waiting till the new network is 
fully operational and we will be requiring the 
service provider to improve frequency and 
punctuality.  
8.8  
Tax Rebate for Parents using School Transport 
The tax rebate given to parents whose children 
made use of school transport to commute to and 
from  Church and independent schools will remain 
in force. We shall be exploring more options to 
encourage this means of transportation. 
8.9  
Tax Credits for Enterprises offering Transport 
for their Personnel 
Transport Malta, in conjunction with Malta 
Enterprise, will start talks with constituted bodies, 
trade unions and the industrial zone associations, 
for the introduction of incentives for those 
enterprises offering transport for their personnel, 
encouraging them to join forces in  the provision of 
such transport, or to give incentives to their 
employees to use public transport. 
 
111 
 
8.10  New Means of Transport in the Ports 
Through the Connections project, for which a call 
of expressions of interest has already been issued, 
we expect sea transport to and from Valletta from 
Sliema and the south of the country to become 
more accessible. We are also exploring ways of 
making it more convenient for commuters reaching 
the shores of Valletta to access Valletta centre. For 
the longer term, Government is also exploring 
alternative 
methods 
of 
transport, 
including 
underground tunnels as well as people movers 
above ground. 
Transport 
Malta 
will 
embark 
on 
a 
wide 
consultation process with car drivers and all those 
who use roads on a regular basis, to listen to 
suggestions about how traffic problems may be 
alleviated, as well as to better identify problem 
spots on roads and various circumstances which 
are creating more congestion. 
8.11  Discipline on the Road 
We need greater discipline on the road.  Behaviour 
such as driving under the influence with the 
accompanying hazard of accidents that could be 
fatal for drivers, passengers and third parties, 
cannot be tolerated. The Police Force is currently in 
negotiations 
for 
the 
acquisition 
of 
new 
breathalysing equipment which can give an 
instantaneous reading and printout.  This will cut 
down on the bureaucracy that plagued the past 
years when the current equipment was too 
cumbersome to use. The law will be amended to 
 
112 
 
cater for the new system, whilst fines for driving 
under the influence will be made more onerous. 
The use of mobile phones whilst driving is one of 
the leading causes of accidents. Fines will be 
increased in cases of drivers using handsets or 
texting whilst driving. We shall also be introducing 
new regulations regarding the illegal use in Malta 
of imported cars with foreign number plates which 
are not locally registered. 
8.12  Car Parks 
Government will undertake two new pilot PPPs so 
that, together with local councils, sites could be 
identified for the building of car parks, preferably 
below ground. Mosta and Marsascala are two 
localities 
where 
lack 
of 
parking 
space 
is 
particularly marked. 
8.13  Car Sharing and a National Cycling Plan 
We are currently working on a policy regarding car 
sharing and car pooling, intended to spell out the 
advantages for persons travelling to the same 
destination when using one car. In this regard, 
Transport Malta has helped in the development of 
an application to be released shortly. Meanwhile  
we shall shortly be working on a  National Cycling 
Plan  
 
 
 
113 
 
Tourism 
 
 
8.14  Airmalta 
We shall continue with our efforts to reach the 
objectives of the restructuring plan. 
This year we completed a number of initiatives our 
predecessors left on the shelf because they did not 
have the courage to take action.  Amongst others, 
we revised the catering and IT contracts.  
We want to ensure that by the end of this period, 
the national airline will have a medium and longer 
term growth plan that is sustainable and assures 
opportunities for the airline's employees within the 
reality of a company that is operating in the most 
competitive market of all time.  
 
114 
 
8.15  Tourism Legislation Reform 
We fully intend to carry out legislative reform to 
ease the bureaucratic obstacles faced by operators 
in tourism and for legislation in this field to be 
better 
organized. 
This 
would 
lead 
to 
a 
simplification of licensing, better enforcement and 
a more varied typology of establishments with the 
introduction of new categories such as Boutique 
Hotels. Around 6,000 operators in the tourism 
industry will benefit from this reform.  At the same 
time we shall continue to co-operate with agencies 
such as MEPA and the Property Division for the 
introduction of other policies of mutual interest 
such as that governing the setting of tables and 
chairs by establishments on public land. 
 
8.16  Corporation for the Regeneration of St 
George's Bay 
It is evident that in the coming years there will be a 
concentration of quality projects in the region of St 
George's Bay in St Julians.  Whilst favouring such 
projects we cannot allow this highly important area 
to be turned into an open construction site for an 
extended period of time. 
There is therefore a need for total co-ordination in 
this project to create synergies and minimise 
inconvenience. There is also the need of a single 
point of contact with government authorities and 
agencies to limit bureaucracy and hasten the works 
in hand. A comprehensive plan for the area is 
clearly essential, both in order to improve 
 
115 
 
infrastructure and to minimise the inconvenience 
caused to existing businesses and residents. 
With this in mind we will be setting up the St 
George's 
Bay 
Regeneration 
Corporation, 
in 
partnership with private interests, to take in hand 
the necessary co-ordination.  For its initial phase 
this corporation will operate under the GHRC.   
 
116 
 
8.17  Calendar of Events 
We are co-operating with various entities with the 
aim of bringing together and consolidating the 
calendar of cultural events thus enabling the Malta 
Tourism Authority to promote it abroad at 
international fairs together with operators in the 
sector. 
8.18  Mediterranean Conference Centre 
In the current year and the following three years, 
Government will be working on a capital project 
with a view to preserving the edifice, upgrading 
the services and generating new business for the 
Mediterranean Conference Centre. 
Amongst other things, we plan to improve 
accessibility with the installation of two lifts for use 
by the public; unused spaces like the roof of the 
Sacra Infermeria will be converted and utilized; 
Republic Hall will be upgraded; Perellos Chapel 
will be restored.   It is intended to modernize all 
facilities and undertake an ambitious project for 
the soundproofing of the various halls.  We are also 
working on a shuttle bus service to transport 
visitors from the car parks surrounding Valletta to 
the MCC. For some of these projects we shall be 
applying for funding from the European Union.  
 
117 
 
Energy 
8.19  Reduced Utility Bills 
We intend to continue working on a plan that is 
not only helping with the recovery of Enemalta but 
has allowed us to reduce utility bills in a 
responsible and sustainable manner. We are also in 
talks with the social partners regarding various 
initiatives, 
some 
of 
which 
they 
themselves 
proposed, such as incentives for a more efficient 
use of energy. to further assist businesses.   
8.20  Improving the financial situation of Enemalta 
Under this administration Enemalta financial 
outlook has improved significantly. Through 
continuous commitment, Enemalta is becoming 
sustainable and no longer depends on high tariffs 
or the support of the Central Government for its 
operation, as was the case previously.  The target is 
for Enemalta to start registering a profit by 2017. 
8.21  Partnership with Shanghai Electric Power 
Enemalta is working with its strategic partner 
Shanghai Electric Power to commence operations 
in two joint companies leading to Enemalta 
investing in new international projects in the field 
of renewable energy and the provision of an 
energy service centre. These investments will 
strengthen the company's financial situation and 
offer new job opportunities . 
 
 
118 
 
8.22  Changeover to gas at Delimara 
Next year, the country will have a new gas power 
station.  It will be a power station of the highest 
level in terms of efficiency and emission reduction. 
This is a project which is being consistently praised 
by credit rating agencies and even by the European 
Commission as being crucial in this field after 
many years during which nothing was ever done 
to address the country-specific recommendation 
served on Malta every year by the European 
Commission for this purpose. The Delimara 
project, financed by ElectroGas, is progressing at a 
fast pace.  SEP is also working on the conversion to 
gas at Delimara 3. 
 
 
8.23  Combatting Energy Theft 
During next year Enemalta will maintain the 
campaign it started in 2104 to send out that 
message that EneMalta plc will not tolerate 
electricity theft. Trends indicate that there was a 
record decrease of 33% in non-technical losses in 
2014 and 2015 will be another year with very good 
results with respect of non-technical losses due to 
theft or other illegalities. 
 
8.24  Closedown of Marsa Power Station 
After 62 years, we have finally closed down the 
power station at Marsa. This is having a positive 
 
119 
 
impact on air quality and a cleaner environment 
for the residents in the neighbourhood. The 
demolition of the power station will continue 
during 2016. Plans will also be finalised for the 
removal of the old power plant at Delimara and the 
necessary works will commence, starting with the 
removal of the large chimney.     
 
120 
 
8.25  Investing in the Distribution System  
Enemalta is focusing the greater part of its 
operations  on strengthening its power distribution 
network through the building or extension of 
various distribution centres, among them the ones 
in Marsa, Manoel Island, St Andrew's Santa 
Venera, Xewkija and Mellieha. This investment is 
essential for a reliable distribution of electricity 
from Enemalta to households and businesses, to 
ensure fewer power cuts and shorter down times. 
This aspect of operations grows in importance in 
view of the economic growth of the Maltese 
economy characterised by large scale investments.  
Next year, Enemalta will be adding to the 
connections between various parts of the network 
and will also acquire new equipment permitting 
the main substations in all localities in Malta and 
Gozo to be operated from the Company's central 
control room. This will allow a better control of 
these important nodes in the distribution system 
and a more immediate intervention in emergency 
situations. 
 
8.26  Finalisation of the Interconnector 
Enemalta has started the process that will allow 
additional capacity in the fibre optic link of the 
interconnector between Malta and Sicili to be used 
by the private sector.  
 
 
121 
 
8.27  Price Stability 
We will continue to strive for stability in the price 
of gas. The current price will be retained up to the 
end of next April.  This is the lowest price in the 
past four years. It also means that the price of gas 
would have been stable for 9 whole months 
including the cold winter months.   
This same policy of stability will apply to fuel 
prices. Although the rate of excise duty will go up, 
fuel prices will go down as of next January.  This 
Government is looking for price stability as against 
fluctuations in pricing from month to month with 
consumers having to carry the burden whenever 
the price went up. 
8.28  ARMS Ltd 
In the coming year a collective effort is planned for 
more efficient methods of payment collection from 
the public.  These include online payments - 
through banks or the company's portal, at 
Maltapost branches, Local Councils, by cheque or 
direct debits where the amount due is reduced by 
2% or €3.  
8.29  Incentives 
Various incentives were launched during 2015 in 
favour of the installation of solar panel systems.  
This scheme will remain in force up till the end of 
January 2016.  It is anticipated that 20 megawatts of 
solar panels would have been allocated this year.  
 
 
122 
 
8.30  Feed-In Tariffs 
In the coming months, attractive albeit sustainable 
feed-in-tariffs will continue to be offered. We shall 
be extending the feed-in-tariffs to apply also to 
panels that are integrated in building structures.  
 
8.31  Solar Farms 
Talks 
are 
currently 
in 
progress 
between 
Government and business associations for the joint 
development of solar farms. 
A new scheme is being considered for panels larger 
than 1 megawatt to be given incentives within the 
regulatory framework of the European Union 
which came into force in 2014 and through which 
tariffs would be awarded on the basis of best bid.  
 
8.32  Renewable Energy targets. 
Malta kept the rhythm picked up in 2013 to reach 
the target of 10% in renewable energy by 2020, and 
indeed it is anticipated that by the end of 2015 we 
would have approached 5%. 
The energy auditors who were given specific 
training are now prepared to carry out high level 
energy audits in all sectors. The next step is to pass 
on the knowledge acquired from the audits of large 
enterprises to small and medium enterprises  and 
this will proceed according to plan throughout the 
coming year. 
 
123 
 
8.33  Community Solar Farms 
Government is committed to fulfil its electoral 
pledge and to offer families, who have no access to 
a roof where panels could be installed, the 
opportunity to have such access in other ways.   
This will come about through a project which will 
identify sites where a substantial number of 
photovoltaic 
panels 
could 
be 
installed 
and 
subsequently bought by these families. Thus the 
energy generated could be reflected in the 
individual utility bills of these families, giving 
them the opportunity to benefit from further 
reductions in their energy cost. 
8.34  Campaign in favour of Energy Efficiency and 
Water Conservation. 
As promised, we also launched a campaign 
through a pilot project to raise awareness of the 
need of energy efficiency and water conservation 
among residents.  15 thousand invitations were 
sent out to households in Mosta, Qormi, Paola, and 
Tarxien so that, on a voluntary basis and free of 
charge, specially trained officers could carry out 
house inspections and advise on more efficient use 
of electricity and water and to make residents 
aware of other sources of renewable energy.  in the 
coming year it is planned to extend this project 
nationwide. 
8.35  Funds and Initiatives 
This year we also successfully finalised an 
agreement with the European Union for the 
 
124 
 
allocation of no less than €58 million in funds for 
the period 2014 to 2020, earmarked for renewable 
energy schemes and other incentives for a more 
efficient use of energy. At the current time, 
together with Malta Enterprise, we are devising 
programmes wherein SMEs could benefit from 
financial incentives when investing in equipment 
and implementing measures to render their use of 
energy more efficient. 
8.36  EU Projects for a better understanding of 
energy use to minimise consumption 
During this year several projects were launched 
intended 
to 
improve 
efficiency 
in 
energy 
consumption. These projects cost over €4.5 million 
and are being co-financed through European 
Union funds.  They were all initiated by this 
Government in 2013 as part of a collective effort to 
avoid the unnecessary loss of funds under the 
operative programme 2007-2013.  These projects 
are now in the final stages of their implementation 
and are nearing completion. 
During 2016 new applications will be co-ordinate 
by this division for new projects in this sector, also 
financed by the European Union. 
 
 
125 
 
8.37  Studies for a Gas Pipeline 
The study on the implementation of the gas 
pipeline project has now entered another phase 
and work has already started on identifying an 1.2 
kilometre corridor on the sea bed where the 
pipeline 
could 
be 
laid 
and 
to 
assess 
the 
environmental impact, both on the Maltese side as 
well as the Italian side. For this project we 
successfully acquired €400,000 in EU funds under 
the Connecting Europe Facility, following an 
application submitted in April.  We shall be 
working on this study during the coming year. 
 
 
 
126 
 
Water 
 
8.38  Water Services Corporation - Infrastructual 
Projects 
Next year the Water Services Corporation plans to 
apply for the necessary European Union funds to 
improve 
its 
infrastructure, 
both 
in 
water 
distribution and drainage.  A number of capital 
projects have already been identified in this regard. 
These include the construction of an underground 
gallery from the Reverse Osmosis plant in 
Pembroke through to the reservoir in Ta' Qali, as 
well as the construction of a reservoir which 
guarantees an adequate supply of drinking water.  
Through 
EU 
funds 
under 
the 
2014-2020 
programme, the Corporation will continue to 
invest in Gozo and plans to apply for the building 
of a Reverse Osmosis plant to reduce dependence 
on the Cirkewwa plant whilst improving water 
quality. 
 
127 
 
8.39  New Water 
Amongst the projects successfully completed by 
the Corporation during the current year, was that 
of the purification of treated drainage water, to be 
supplied as an alternative source of water for 
agriculture and industry. This new resource of 
alternative water will significantly reduce the 
deficit between the national water demand and 
supply and will permit Malta to achieve the good 
status 
objectives 
demanded 
by 
the 
Water 
Framework Directive. The capital expenditure for 
this project totalled just under €19 million. 
8.40  Reverse Osmosis Upgrading 
It is anticipated that during 2016, the Corporation 
will continue to invest more that €2 million in 
upgrades in its Reverse Osmosis plants.  Through 
this investment, which is expected to yield a return 
on investment over a period of four years, the 
Corporation would be significantly reducing its 
dependence on electricity, thus reaching is targets, 
both financial and environmental. 
 
 
128 
 
8.41  Leakage detection 
In the coming year, the Corporation will be 
carrying out field studies in Morocco and Tunisia, 
financed by the World Bank. 
During the current year, the Corporation invested 
in human resources so that now it has a team of 
dedicated workers to carry out inspections for 
water theft. 
8.42  Water Management National Plan 
The Water Management National Plan was 
reviewed 
by 
Global 
Water 
Partnership 
- 
Mediterranean 
(an 
international 
management 
organization in the water sector), to ensure that the 
proposed plan follows the principles of Integrated 
Water Resource Management. 
8.43  Valley Conservation Integrated Plan 
In collaboration with the Ministry For Transport 
and Infrastructure, a plan is being drafted for the 
conservation and development of valleys in the 
country. There are plans for the first conservation 
works to be carried out in Wied il-Qlejjgha and 
Wied Ghajn Rihana, under a programme co-
financed by the European Union Structural Funds 
2014-2020. This plan envisages not only the 
cleaning of the valleys but also the development of 
recreational centres providing information about 
the characteristics of our rural environment. 
 
 
129 
 
8.44  Rehabilitation of Public Water Reservoirs 
Another important aspect to be address during the 
coming year involves the rehabilitation of public 
water reservoirs - a public infrastructure that for 
the greater part is sadly not utilized. For this 
purpose, the SEWCU is collaborating with the 
Ministry For Transport and Infrastructure for the 
eventual launch of a programme of rehabilitation 
with 
co-financing 
by 
the 
European 
Union 
Structural Funds 2014-2020. The full utilization of 
these public water reservoirs should lead to better 
use of storm water, less dependence on the water 
table and a reduction of the dangers caused by 
flooding. 
 
8.45  National Centre for Water Conservation 
It is planned to set up a National Centre for Water 
Conservation in Rabat (Malta). This centre will 
offer 
a 
multimedia 
experience 
about 
the 
importance of water and the need for a better use 
of this resource. In addition, the Centre will also 
include open spaces with facilities such as a hands-
on science area with a view to offering family 
recreation. The development of this centre is co-
financed but the European Economic Area fund.

G. Gozo: Creating More Prosperity 
9.1  
Gozitan Students in Malta 
The allowance paid to Gozitan Students in Malta 
will be increased by €300 per annum for each 
student. This measure will come into effect as of 
next year. 
 
9.2  
Extension of the University Campus in Gozo 
Works will start on the University campus in 
Gozo for the construction of a new wing to house 
students reading specialised doctorates and 
carrying out research. 
 
9.3  
Studies for the Construction of the Rural 
Airfield in Gozo 
Significant progress was registered in the studies 
relative to this potential investment which offers 
an alternative connection to Malta. 
 
 
9.4  
Tender for a Cruise Liner Terminal and Yacht 
Marina in Gozo 
Discussions are underway with a consortium that 
submitted its proposals. 
 
 
 
131 
 
9.5  
Malta-Gozo Tunnel 
An important step forward was made this year 
with regards to the options for a permanent link 
between Malta and Gozo. 
 
Transport Malta and the Gozo Business Chamber 
jointly commissioned a study which analysed 
various scenarios and methods. The study 
concluded 
that, 
if 
this 
project 
eventually 
materialised, the option that made the most 
economic and financial sense would be a sub-
seabed tunnel.  It also concluded that the project 
could also rope in the direct participation of the 
private sector. The next step is to carry out the 
necessary geological studies that should throw 
light on the technical viability of the selected 
option. It is planned to hasten this process in the 
coming year so that a final decision may be 
reached. 
 
9.6  
A cruise liner buoy in Xlendi 
Studies are being carried out jointly by the 
Ministry for Transport and Infrastructure and the 
Ministry for Gozo regarding a new buoy which is 
needed to replace the existing one in Xlendi. 
These studies are at an advanced stage and 
include careful consideration of the preservation 
of the natural habitat and archaeological remains 
on the sea bed. 
 
132 
 
9.7  
Tourism in Gozo 
For the first time a robust advertising campaign 
was undertaken on digital sites, such as Trip 
Advisor and Travel Zoo, to attract more niche 
tourism such as diving, weddings, religious 
activities and a deeper appreciation of the natural 
habitat of the island. 
 
9.8  
Employment and Training Schemes in Gozo 
Various schemes were set in motion together with 
ETC for the training of those registering for work 
or who are inactive. These include on-the-job 
training as well as two other schemes in the 
hospitality sector for training during the winter 
months. Various courses were held, including 
computer training for the general public. 
Other schemes are planned to encourage more 
jobs in Gozo. 
 
9.9  
Digital Hub in Gozo 
A study has just been concluded regarding the 
technical 
and 
financial 
feasibility 
of 
the 
implementation of a digital hub in Gozo. 
Together with Malta Enterprise, we are working 
to attract more investment in this sector.  
 
 
 
133 
 
9.10  Creativity Hub in Gozo 
The application for European funds for the 
development of the site formerly occupied by 
Malta 
Dairy 
Products 
was 
submitted 
in 
September 2015.  The aim is to transform this site 
into a centre for new companies offering 
innovative and creative services, such as the film 
industry. 
9.11  SME park in Gozo 
The industrial estate in Xewkija has potential for 
extension. An application has been submitted for 
European funds to build a park for small 
enterprises for these to operate in a congenial 
environment. 
9.12  Offices to provide new services for Gozitans 
During the course of this last year various offices 
were opened to provide new services for Gozo 
residents. These included the re-opening of the 
MEUSAC representative office, new Probation 
and 
Parole 
offices, 
and 
offices 
for 
the 
Simplification 
of 
Bureaucracy 
Division, 
e-
residence and regional statistics.   The Social 
Work Division was transferred to the new Gozo 
Childcare Development Centre.  The Gozo Sports 
Board and the Gozo Youth Council were also set 
up to service these two sectors. 
9.13  Public Works around Gozo 
Works were carried out on the upgrading of the 
tal-Qbajjar promenade and more works are in 
 
134 
 
progress in Marsalforn and Xlendi; necessary 
works for the benefit of fisherman were taken in 
hand on the Marsalforn inlet and other sites for 
the benefit of divers such as Xatt l-Aħmar and  
Blata tal-Fessej; upgrading works were carried 
out in major squares and streets in various parts 
of Rabat, Nadur, Xewkija, Għajnsielem and 
Xagħra, including 10km of roads from Ħondoq ir-
Rummien to Ta' Ċenċ. Restoration works were 
carried out on the facade of the Banca Giuratale 
on Independence Square in Victoria, Gozo.  
Several photovoltaic panels were installed at the 
Taċ-Ċawla Housing Estate.  A new parquet will 
be laid at the Gozo Gymnasium and works will 
continue on the extension of the Rabat Cemetery. 
Plans are in hand for the upgrading of more 
streets and squares as well as the tarmac 
surfacing of a number of roads around Gozo. 
 
 
135 
 
9.14  Ċittadella restoration 
The restoration of the Ċittadella, which cost €14 
million, 
is 
nearing 
completion 
and 
it 
is 
anticipated that the works will be concluded by 
the end of the year. Apart from the restoration of 
this jewel in the centre of the island, access to the 
site will also be upgraded and more services, such 
as an interpretation centre, will be made 
available. 
 
9.15  New premises for the Gozo Law Courts 
Following consultation with MEPA, new plans 
were 
drafted 
to 
better 
accommodate 
this 
development. 
 
9.16  Medical Hub in Gozo 
The investment which is anticipated for 2016 in 
this field will introduce new medical services 
leading to the creation of a medical hub in Gozo. 
9.17  Homes for the elderly in Gozo 
In the course of this year excavation works were 
undertaken and the contraction of the home will 
start in 2016.  The premises are expected to also 
accommodate couples and will contain 70 rooms 
to house 140 elderly persons. In addition there 
will be a special extension for those suffering 
from dementia. 
 
136 
 
9.18  Refund of salaries for new employment in 
Gozo 
We are rolling out more incentives for new jobs in 
the private sector in Gozo. For each employee 
offered a contract of three years or more, 20% of 
the salary would be refunded up to a maximum 
of €5,000. 
9.19  Other Projects 
Other projects to improve quality of life in Gozo 
in the coming years are the building of a 
swimming pool and the regeneration of St Francis 
Square which will include new access to the main 
car parks in Victoria.  The Ministry for Gozo will 
continue its intensive programme of cleaning and 
upgrading valleys and the rebuilding of rubble 
walls in various localities. 
We shall continue with our endeavours to create 
more jobs in Gozo through the transfer of more 
back-office work from Malta.  Amongst these is 
the salary section of the Police Department. More 
incentives will be given for the creation of new 
jobs in Gozo and for foreign investment to boost 
and diversify the economy of Gozo. 
Applications have been submitted for the 
restoration of historical sites in Gozo, including 
the aqueduct through which water used to flow 
from Santa Lucia to Rabat, the Xewkija mill and 
Calypso's cave.  We also have plans for a Gozo 
museum and for the first time there will be line 
item to acquire objects of art for this museum. 
 
137 
 
H: Promoting Sports and Culture 
10.1  National Swimming Pool 
Following the extensive works carried out this 
year, the national swimming pool in Tal-Qroqq 
will be further modernised with the replacement 
of the deck, as well as the retrofitting of 
equipment to make the pool more energy friendly 
and to cut down heating costs. The water 
reservoir will be rehabilitated to capture rain 
water for use in the same pool. 
10.2  Capital Projects for Sports 
Plans will be drafter for other works on 
swimming pools in Marsascala, Cottonera, Ħad-
Dingli and Pembroke. The flooring in the 
Cottonera gym complex will be replaced and the 
gymnastics hall will be extended. A shallow pool 
will be built in the Ħal-Kirkop complex and more 
works will be carried out in the Marsa sports 
complex. 
Also during next year the racecourse in Marsa 
will undergo all the necessary works to upgrade it 
to international standards. 
10.3  New Sports Initiatives 
With a view to bringing the Malta Sports Council 
closer to sports federations and provide children 
with more opportunites for sports education, 
Government will launch new academies for 
basketball, volleyball and gymnastics. 
Government is also seeking to provide a facility 
 
138 
 
for judo and to develop more jogging tracks 
around Malta.  
The possibility of building a shooting range of 
international standards will be further explored. 
10.4  Sports Facilities at the Youth Village 
Together with the Youth Agency we shall be 
seeking to build sports facilities at the Youth 
Village for the use of ALP students and Youth Inc 
as well as other young people from sports 
associations. 
10.5  White Paper about Professionalism in Sport 
In the coming months a White Paper will be 
published for discussion with sport associations 
regarding how these clubs and associations could 
attract investment in their facilities so that sport 
in Malta could be managed more sustainably and 
on a more solid base.   
 
 
 
139 
 
Culture 
10.6  European Funds for Investment in Cultural 
Capital Projects 
In the coming year we will be concentrating on 
the conclusion of the Hypogeum project and we 
will be working on new initiatives under the 
ERDF 2014-2020 fund programme. The central 
initiative 
will 
be 
the 
application 
for 
the 
rehabilitation and modernisation of the Notorial 
Archives in Valletta as of 2016. 
 
10.7  Valletta 2018 - European Cultural Capital 
Preparations are under way for a suitable plan to 
usher in the City of Valletta as the European 
Cultural Capital for the year 2018.  In addition, a 
number of applications have been submitted for 
European funds to subsidise Government's 
capital expenditure on several important projects 
which will leave their mark on the cultural scene 
of our country well beyond 2018. Amongst the 
applications submitted are the Valletta Design 
Cluster, The MUŻA project, the Grand Salon for 
Costume, Fashion and Film and the Malta 
International Contemporary Art Space. We shall 
also be actively seeking private investment for the 
regeneration of the Valletta closed market. 
 
 
 
140 
 
10.8  Fortifications 
We shall continue with the extensive restoration 
of the various fornications around Malta.  By 2016 
we shall have given back to the people of Malta 
and Gozo two priceless forts, Fort St Elmo and 
Fort St Angelo.  By the end of this year we would 
also have added new facilities at St Paul's 
Catacombs in addition to the building a 
protective canopy over the Tarxien Temples and 
other significant restoration works.  
10.9  The South Side of St Elmo 
Following the completion of the restoration and 
regeneration of upper St Elmo, it became even 
more evident that the lower part of the fort sorely 
needed to be likewise rehabilitated.  We believe 
this is an opportunity for the private sector to 
make a high quality investment which respects 
the historical value of the site and transforms this 
part of the fort into a live attraction. Government 
is therefore issuing a request for proposals for the 
regeneration of the lower part of Fort St Elmo.  
This process should lead to the restoration of the 
majestic edifices of this part of the fort as well as 
all the open spaces within it and to breathe life 
into the fort through new activities undertaken by 
the private sector.  
10.10  World Art and Culture Summit 
In the coming year, the Malta Arts Council will be 
hosting the seventh World Summit for Art and 
Culture with 400 delegates from 80 countries 
 
141 
 
round the world.  This will be done in partnership 
with the International Federation of Arts Councils 
and Cultural Agency (IFACCA) 
10.11  Malta's Participation in the Venice Biennale 
As also pledged in the electoral programme, we 
shall endeavour to reactivate Malta's participation 
in the Venice Biannale of 2017.  A new vote will 
therefore be allocated for the initial investment 
which for this year will amount to €100,000 for a 
total expenditure of €350,000 over two years. 
10.12  New Partnerships with Cultural Organisations 
Through restructuring and the allocation of 
additional funds for the Malta Arts Council, a 
competitive fund of €500,000 will be set up to 
provide co-financing to the principal partners in 
this plan over a period of three years. 
10.13  Establishment of Teatru Malta 
Two years ago we announced the setting up of 
DanceMalta, and in the same way we are now 
making the initial investment to set up a 
professional structure for the theatre with a view 
to promoting theatrical works which are relevant 
to contemporary society and of artistic excellence 
which 
includes 
experimentation 
in 
style, 
dramatology, technology and scripting, amongst 
other things. This will come about through 
productions and co-productions with artists and 
theatrical companies, both Maltese and foreign. 
 
 
142 
 
I: National Security 
11.1  Detention Service 
The first ever sectional agreement between 
Government and the General Workers' Union 
(GWU) was signed this year. For 2016 it is 
envisaged to strengthen security through the use of 
CCTV as well as the installation of a complete 
system of radio communication. 
 
11.2  Civil Protection Department 
The department will soon start using another three 
new all-terrain vehicles purchased for €130,000. 
The operation of the department was also 
strengthened with the acquisition of numerous 
pieces of new equipment including digital radios 
(€23,000), three USAR rigs (€69,000), a digital 
telephone system, 125 fire-fighting suits (€51,000) 
and another 65 are in the process of being 
purchased, six rescue dogs, a drone for use in cases 
of 
firework 
factory 
explosions 
and 
similar 
situations, 250 helmets (€43,000) new apparatus for 
use by Hazmat as well as the installation of 
photovoltaic panels at the Xemxija station. 
For 2016 the department's fleet will be enlarged. 6 
light fire engines and a high capacity foam carrier 
have already been ordered and are expected to be 
delivered at the beginning of next year. The value 
of these new trucks is €1.2 million. Agreement was 
also reached with the Ministry for Finance for the 
acquisition of another 12 vehicles with an 
 
143 
 
expenditure 
of 
€2.5 
million. 
 
The 
tender 
specifications are currently being formulated. It is 
also anticipated that during 2016 the CPD will start 
working on larger and more modern quarters in 
Hal Far, close to the fire fighting station. The CPD 
has also applied for EU funds under the ISF 
programme where a project is being proposed for 
the reinforcement of the Hazmat division.  The 
value 
is 
estimated 
at 
€700,00. 
It is also anticipated that the voluntary service 
would be strengthened during 20161.  
 
144 
 
11.3  Investment in the Malta Armed Forces 
(Equipment and Human Resources) 
In the pipeline for 216 are a large number of 
projects 
and 
initiatives 
which 
include 
the 
acquisition of three new helicopters to the value of 
€13.9 million, which contract has already been 
signed (30th June 2015); the purchase of a third 
new aeroplane costing €15 million and the 
commencement of structural works on the Army 
Base at Pembroke to accommodate a military 
training school.  We have also earmarked an 
investment of €2.5 million for new military 
equipment as part of the modernisation of the 
Force. 
In addition, there are also   a number of capital 
projects co-sponsored by ISF for the period 2014-
2020, the processing of which will start in 2016 and 
which are estimated to cost €75  million over five 
years.  These include the acquisition of an offshore 
patrol vessel for the sum of around €38 million and 
the purchase of a robot and van for the EOD 
estimated to cost around one and half million 
Euros. 
To limit bureaucracy, the  AFM is holding talks 
with the Management Efficiency Unit within the 
OPM for a computerised system of inventory of 
ammunition and uniforms as well as another 
programme for a more precise and efficient audit 
of AFM vehicle repairs. 
Finally, €500,000 are budgeted for training of 
officers and soldiers in 2016, both in Malta and 
 
145 
 
abroad as well as €400,000 earmarked for the 
participation of AFM officers and men in missions 
outside the country. 
2016 will see an increase in the allowance paid to 
members of the Armed Forces Malta. This increase 
will double the allowance given at present. 
Once the relative legislation, already on the 
Parliamentary agenda, is approved, there will be a 
call for more Reservists. 
In 2016 the AFM also intend to engage 100 new 
recruits and 10 new cadet officers. 
 
146 
 
11.4  Police Force Economic Crimes Unit  
The Economic Crimes Unit of the Police Force is 
being strengthened in terms of human resources, 
and the Squad has gone up from six Inspectors to 
ten. More personnel is also being added to their 
Investigation Teams.  For 2016 it is envisaged that 
this Squad will be strengthened with the addition 
of more professional members such as accountants 
and other professionals.  If these professional 
resources are not found within the Police Corps 
they will be engaged from outside the Corps. The 
Squad will be further bolstered with the acquisition 
of new tools required for analysis. 
11.5  Strengthening the Probation and Parole 
Department 
There are plans for the launch in 2016 of an IT 
project, to be known as Offender Management 
System, enabling users of this system (prisons, law 
courts, probation and parole) to have more efficient 
networking.  All personnel underwent extended 
training to improve the service given to the public. 
A pilot project, known as Anger Management 
aimed at clients making use of the DPP, was also 
rolled out this year.  The Victim Offender 
Meditation service will also be expanded and the 
mediation process will be launched in 2016.  Also 
in the pipeline is more training for psychologists in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
National 
Offenders 
Management System of the United Kingdom in 
programmes aimed at rehabilitation. 
 
147 
 
11.6  The Police Force 
The Forensic Laboratory will acquire accreditation 
this year. In addition, the IT division was 
strengthened to be better able to enforce the 
programme of border control with the acquisition 
of finger print scanners, passport scanners and 
webcams, and this in view of the control 
necessitated by Schengen.  EU funds were invested 
in an Advanced Passenger Information (API) 
system for the checking of arrivals from outside the 
Schengen Area. 
More substantial investment will be made in the 
acquisition of new computers as well as other 
equipment for the police force, such as bullet proof 
vests.  To reinforce human resources it is hoped 
that new recruits will be taken in during 2016.  In 
the coming year the Immigration Division together 
with the National Schengen Information Systems 
Unit, will launch a project leading to the utilisation 
of new machinery for an automated border control 
as part of the EU Smart Borders project.  This 
project is estimated to cost one million Euros. 
The Police Force has applied for various projects to 
be co-financed by the EU for the period 2014-2020 
under the ISF and AMIF programmes. These 
include €1 million for expenses related to 
repatriation of  immigrants not eligible for refugee 
status, a quarter of a million Euros for training 
with other countries, €400,000 for the purchase of 
equipment for the Force, half a million Euros for 
law enforcement entities to have access to the 
Europol and Interpol databases, the strengthening 
 
148 
 
of the Cyber Crime Unit amounting to €1.4 million, 
the extension of the Operations Room in the NS-SIS 
premises amounting to around €200,00, the 
purchase of a surveillance van for costing €90,000, 
the setting up of a command and control room 
estimated to cost €2.25 million and another 
€800,000 for the extension of the automated case 
management system. 
 
 
149 
 
11.7  Police Academy 
2016 will see the introduction of another proposal 
to improve police presence in tourist areas. This 
will come about following special training of a 
number of members of the force.  
In another programme, various police stations in 
Malta and Gozo will be given a facelift for 
members of the force to be better able to extend 
good service to the public. 
11.8  Identity Malta 
This agency has several projects for 2016 including 
the joint project with MEPA for the online 
acquisition of  site plans from the Department of 
Land Registration.  This will lead to the finalisation 
of a new system of researches  regarding land, 
contracts and other legal instruments within the 
department of Public and Land Registration.  The 
first phase is expected to be completed towards the 
end of 2016. The main software will be updated 
with more participation by the Police Force and the 
ETC as the principle stakeholders in the process.  
Another investment will be made by Identity Malta 
with regards to the process of the Single Permit, 
whereby the residence and work permits will be 
embodied in a single document in accordance with 
EU directives. More investment is envisaged in 
passport issue with the acquisition of new 
equipment for the personalisation of passports, 
namely the inclusion of the person's particulars 
and well as the programming of biometric details 
in the passport chip. 
 
150 
 
11.9  Corradino Correctional Facility 
The Ministry is committed to financially assist 
various NGOs including the Prison Fellowship and 
the RISE Foundation. A call for tenders has been 
issued for the extension of the youth Correctional 
Facility in Imtaħleb, which project is financed 
jointly with Norwegian funding to the amount of 
one million Euros. This extension is expected to be 
completed by the third quarter of next year. 
Related to this funding is a training programme for 
Maltese personnel by officers of Norwegian 
Correctional Facilities engaged in the running of 
youth facilities. 
Various capital projects for the modernisation of 
the Corradino Facility are anticipated for 2016. 
 
 
 
151 
 
J. Creating a Just, Equal and Inclusive Society 
12.1  Justice System Reform 
Government promised a holistic reform in the 
Justice system and the law courts and this is being 
carried out. Much has already been done, 
including the introduction of new procedures and 
rights which have already brought about tangible  
improvements. At the same time numerous new 
systems, both technical and procedural, were 
introduced, and will continue to be introduced, in 
the civil courts to eradicate bureaucracy and time 
wasting. 
The physical space of the Law Courts was 
expanded with the opening of the Judiciary 
Building. This was a decision that caters not only 
for the present but also for future exigencies and 
allows for the expansion of human resources in 
our Courts. 
Further efforts will be made to fulfil the 
recommendations made by the Holistic Justice 
Reform Commission in its final report. 
During the coming year we shall be focusing on 
four main areas: 
Firstly, we need to entrench new rights in the 
field of criminal justice to further boost personal 
guarantees and safeguards. For this purpose the 
right to the presence of an advocate during arrest 
will be further fine tuned and improved.  In 
addition, a pilot project will be launched whereby 
court prosecutions will be conducted by a lawyer 
instead of a member of the Police Force, who in 
 
152 
 
most cases would also have been the investigating 
officer. 
Secondly, in the civil camp we shall undertake an 
unprecedented initiative to introduce in Malta the 
culture which predominates on a European level, 
namely the culture of recourse to mediation prior 
to court litigation. We believe that mediation is a 
powerful tool which, if employed well, gives 
good results, more speedily and  in many cases, at 
a lesser cost for the citizen. During the coming 
year we 
shall 
be 
pushing a number of 
amendments to improve and modernise this legal 
field and we shall endeavour to raise awareness 
about the benefits of mediation on a national 
level. 
Thirdly, in the field of commerce we shall be 
giving priority to two legal institutes which in 
recent generations have been neglected, namely 
bankruptcy proceedings and the enforcement of 
contracts.  
Fourthly, we shall be investing in the expansion 
of human resources in our Courts, including the 
assigning of full time lawyers to assist judges in 
the Civil Courts. These lawyers would be chosen 
by the judges themselves, as is currently the 
practice in the selection of other officers of the 
Court such as Children's advocates, and will 
assist judges in research and the preparation of 
judgements on the model of continental jurists.  
Concurrently, we shall improve the training 
programme for judges and law courts staff, even 
with the use of EU funds. 
 
153 
 
Special attention will be given to those Courts 
where Government feels the need of shorter times 
in the handing down of judgements. 
At the same time the Department of Justice will 
continue the task, begun this year, of upgrading 
the  legal aid services provided by Government 
with a view to extending this service to more 
beneficiaries. 
 
154 
 
12.2  The Whistlebowers's Act and Party Financing 
Legislation 
Earlier this year, Government implemented two 
pieces of legislation that are crucial to good 
governance - the Whistlblowers' Act and the 
Financing of Political Parties Act. 
The Whistleblowers' Unit, which offers assistance 
to persons wishing to reveal information within 
the scope of the Act, will be reinforced even with 
the relocation of services to one adequate, central 
and easily accessible site from where this unit 
could operate with trained staff instructed to give 
the best possible guidance to whoever comes 
forward with information. 
The Financing of Political Parties Act will come 
into force on 1st January 2016.  This will render 
the operation of parties and election candidates 
more transparent.  Government will ensure that 
in the coming months, and after consultation, the 
necessary regulations for the best enforcement of 
this legislation are implemented.  
12.3  Local Government 
The Local Enforcement System Agency (LESA) 
was formally set up this year to regulate local 
enforcement.  By the end of this year this Agency 
will gradually assume all regulatory functions in 
this field.  
We believe the Agency will make a difference in 
the lives of citizens who, for many years, were 
subjected to practices that severely dented the 
 
155 
 
credibility of this facet of local enforcement. These 
excesses will be curtailed whilst ensuring the 
sustainability of the system with more emphasis 
on education, training and the community aspect.  
We shall launch a consultation process to hand 
over 
new 
co-ordination 
responsibilities 
to 
Regional Committees to assist Local Councils in 
offering a better quality service to their respective 
residents, 
thus 
strengthening 
the 
councils 
themselves. 
The task in the field of local government does not 
end with enforcement.  The project whereby Local 
Councils 
effect 
live 
transmissions 
of 
their 
meetings will now become part of the Local 
Councils' obligations according to law. We will be 
launching another pilot project for members of 
the public to be included to form part of 
adjudicating boards for major projects to enhance 
transparency, particularly with regards to the 
councils' expenditure. 
We  will intensify our commitment in favour of 
art and culture by giving local artists more 
opportunities and will push for local councils to 
make available projects aimed at the training of 
all those wishing to enhance their skills.  
The Għaqal id-Dar Project will be extended to 
more local councils in both Malta and Gozo and 
refuse separation and collection will remain a 
priority. In collaboration with the Ministry 
concerned we shall further extend the pilot 
project of organic waste collection. 
 
156 
 
12.4  Valletta Local Council 
Around the world, town councils of capital cities 
are normally housed in prominent buildings.  The 
City of Valletta is an exception with a local 
council sited in an isolated location and a 
building that falls short of the prestige which such 
an institution deserves. This despite the fact that 
for a number of years the Valletta Local Council 
has been requesting relocation. 
 
Government has therefore decided to relocate the 
Valletta Local Council to Queen Victoria Square 
in the premises formerly occupied by Café 
Premiere. This building will now be of service to 
all residents of Valletta and accord the Council 
the prestige it deserves as our capital city 
prepares to be the European Capital City for 2018. 
 
12.5  Social Security 
We understand that there are many who are in 
genuine need and are unable to work due to 
illness, disability and mental health problems. It 
is our duty to see that these persons and their 
families do not fall into the poverty trap. 
 
With this in mind, and as of the coming year, the 
income of working children of such families will 
no longer be considered for the purposes of 
means testing of the head of the household. This 
means that the amount of €16.30 for each working 
 
157 
 
child still residing in the family home will no 
longer be deducted from the social assistance 
payable. As an example, a family of 4 persons will 
be receiving €125.32c per week instead of the 
current €92.72c.  This measure will cost €1.5 
million and will benefit more than 2,000 families. 
 
158 
 
12.6  Soċjeta Ġusta Project 
We shall be continue with  Project Soċjeta Ġusta- a 
very 
ambitious 
commitment 
taken 
on 
by 
Government  - to provide ten small homes within 
the community, thus giving peace of mind to 
parents of persons with disability who worry 
about their children's future once they themselves 
pass away. 
The first of these homes in Siggiewi is completed 
and is already hosting the first group of residents. 
Another such home, in Gozo, is nearing 
completion, whilst applications for those in Ħaz-
Zabbar and Pembroke are being considered by 
MEPA. The process relating to other homes, 
including the one in Pace Grasso, are at advanced 
stage.  
 
12.7  Extension of Medical Assistance 
Among single persons living with their parents, 
there could be some who cannot work because of 
mental illness or terminal disease. To prevent 
such persons becoming a burden on their parents, 
where either one of the parents receives a 
pension, such persons will be given the right to 
benefit from Medical Assistance. 
 
159 
 
12.8  A Raise in the Drug Addicts Allowance 
Another measure concerns persons who undergo 
drug rehabilitation programmes. These persons 
will receive a benefit, known as Drug Addict 
Allowance, irrespective of their income or the 
income of their families. In addition, this benefit 
will be raised from €23.29 to €30.00 per week. 
 
12.9  Travel 
Restrictions 
on 
Social 
Benefit 
Recipients 
We shall be removing travel restrictions imposed 
to date on recipients of social benefits. Thus, 
persons receiving social benefits will have the 
right to travel to any European Union country for 
a period not exceeding eight days in any calendar 
year without losing their social benefit. Persons 
receiving Non-Contributory Old Age pensions 
who have relatives residing in Australia, New 
Zealand and Canada, will be able to visit their 
relatives for a period not exceeding three months 
without losing their pension.  In the case of 
persons wishing to travel to non-EU countries, the 
visit should be no longer than one month.  
 
12.10  Persons with Disability 
Government will continue with its efforts to 
improve the quality of life of persons with 
disability. 
The National Commission for Persons with 
 
160 
 
Disability (NCPD) will be setting up a call centre 
to improve the services it provides to persons 
with disability and their families. Families 
wanting to care for young people and adults with 
disability will be given support through the 
Sharing Lives scheme. Above all, the support 
given to persons with disability will be enhanced 
through the Empowerment Programme intended 
for disabled persons wishing to live independent 
lives as well as to provide improved respite 
services.  
 
161 
 
12.11  Hub for person's with disability 
Government has for long been working on the 
creation of a well equipped hub for persons with 
disabilities, a place where persons of different 
abilities could meet and integrate with other 
persons having other forms of disability in order 
to promote inclusion and have  access to the 
various services and facilities available in one 
location to make their life easier. 
The hub will not be an institution, but a means of 
promoting inclusion and participation in a 
community. 
The complex will be composed of various 
facilities and services and will be specifically 
designed for persons with disability. Apart from 
residential services to be offered from a part of 
the complex, the hub will include a hostel, a 
respite centre, commercial outlets, gym facilities 
including a pool for hydro therapy, a day centre 
and underground parking.  These services will be 
partially administered by persons with disability 
themselves and will be managed on the concept 
of social enterprise and thus we would be 
promoting an empowerment programme for the 
disabled through which they could acquire 
various skills, including entrepreneurial skills, to 
encourage them to enter the work force and 
acquire more independence.  
Part of this project will be managed together with 
the Malta Guide Dogs Foundation and will 
include programmes for persons affected by 
 
162 
 
blindness and loss of hearing, autistic persons as 
well as people with diabetes.  The range of 
persons who can benefit from the services is 
therefore very significant.  
Apart from adding to the accommodation 
available for this stratum of society, this project 
should be the most clear example of accessibility, 
inclusion, training and development for persons 
with different levels of disability as well as 
offering other services to address the needs 
created by various levels of disability.   This 
project will serve as a prototype of the concept for 
holistic and integrated services on the model of a 
one stop shop. 
 
163 
 
12.12  Home for the Elderly in Birkirkara 
Government will be issuing a call for proposals 
for the building of a home for the elderly in 
Birkirkara. This project will be financed on a PPP 
basis. Once completed, it is anticipated that some 
offices of the Health Department would be 
relocated to this building. 
 
12.13  Consultative Council for the South 
The projected American University of Malta with 
campuses in Dock Number 1 in Cospicua and at 
Zonqor Point in Marsascala will give a strong 
boost to the economy of this region and will 
provide a big push to its regeneration.  
Government's environmental strategy was also 
reflected 
in 
the 
South 
of 
Malta 
where 
environmental studies will be undertaken in 
Wied Blandun. Thus projects and initiatives for 
the coming year will also be geared to the 
economic growth of the south region in full 
respect for the environment. 
 
12.14  A bigger Fund for NGOs 
The 
Funds 
allocated 
for 
non-government 
organisations working in the field of social 
welfare will be better structured.  As of next year, 
these organisations will be requested to enter into 
Public Social Partnerships with the Ministry for 
Social Solidarity, as some have already done, with 
 
164 
 
a view to arriving at a  prior agreement as to the 
aims and objectives to be reached. In this way, 
these organisations would face less bureaucracy 
in acquiring funds since they would not need to 
apply for funds every year.  At the same time 
they would have the assurance of guaranteed 
funds for the whole length of the agreement 
reached with the ministry. 
At the same time, smaller non-government 
organisations, not necessarily engaged in social 
work, will have more opportunities to benefit 
from funds under the Voluntary Organisations 
Fund of the Ministry for Social Dialogue. 
 
165 
 
12.15  Increased Assistance to Coeliacs 
In 
light 
of 
Government's 
commitment 
to 
minimising bureaucracy whilst at the same time 
improving the quality of and access to free health 
services, the Ministry for Energy and Health 
launched a scheme whereby vouchers of a 
monetary value of €30 were given to sufferers of 
Coeliac Disease. Under the current system coeliac 
patients aged 60 and over and those in low 
income groups according the Social Services 
Register received a €50 voucher. 
As a Government that listens and that is always 
close to the people, it has been decided to raise 
the value of the €30 voucher to €45. 
The value of the vouchers is a financial 
supplement to compensate for the difference in 
price of food products containing gluten and 
gluten-free products - that is products not 
containing wheat, barley or rye. This scheme 
shows Government is sensitive to the needs of 
these patients as now their choice of products and 
brands is much wider. 
 
12.16  Upgrading and Maintenance of Housing 
Estates 
In addition to the programme of repairs of leased 
residences, the Housing Authority intends to 
continue its programme of even more extensive 
repair and maintenance projects, as well as the 
refurbishment and embellishment of various 
 
166 
 
housing estates.  
The programme for next year includes projects in 
three localities, amongst which are a block of 48 
units in Hamrun, where it is planned to carry out 
maintenance works, replacement of ceilings and 
roofs as well as a thorough upgrading of the 
extensive common parts of the block. This 
includes the installation of new systems for 
electricity, water and drainage, replacement of 
apertures as well as the cleaning and painting of 
all the common parts. 
The second project covers maintenance works on 
the facades and roofs of various blocks at the Ta' 
Giorni Housing Estate. 
In Pembroke, following the replacement of the 
lighting system in the landscaping surrounding 7 
blocks in Peitro Darmanin Street last year at the 
cost of €40,000,  this year it is planned to carry out 
maintenance works on the facades as well as 
repairs and maintenance of the paving and the 
rain water culverts system to overcome the 
problem of flooding. 
The cost of this upgrading and maintenance 
project will amount to €800,000.

12.17  Building of new Housing Estates 
The Housing Authority is working on a plan 
calculated to meet the ever growing demand for 
social housing. Around 2900 applications are still 
pending before the Authority, many of them 
several years old. The Housing Authority will be 
embarking on a €50million project of new social 
housing in order to increase its stock. The project 
includes the restructuring of existing premises 
and the building of new premises already covered 
but MEPA permits as well as the acquisition of 
neglected private properties. 
 
12.18  Community 
Work 
Scheme 
and 
Document 
Management 
As promised last year, all persons engaged in the 
Community Work Scheme will be transferred to a 
private company so as to receive the dignity they 
deserve.  Now that the operator has been selected, 
all persons on this scheme are in the process of 
being employed. In the coming months we will be 
fulfilling our pledge to scores of persons currently 
in precarious employment.   
In Gozo, the private sector was encouraged to 
employ people with disability.  Now that the 
operator has been selected, a gradual process will 
be rolled out for the interviewing of persons with 
disability to be employed in appropriate jobs.

12.19  Persons with Disability in the Labour Force 
This year we set in motion one of the biggest 
social reforms of all time in the field of labour and 
persons with disabilities, namely the enforcement 
of the legislation that requires all medium and 
large enterprises to employ a percentage of 
persons with disability.  
The results are already evident. Previously, the 
ETC was only able to find work placements for 
less than a 100 special needs persons per year. 
Employment is now found for 24 persons per 
month. This is the result of a strong economy, and 
Government is determined to operate with a 
social conscience. This year, the contribution due 
by companies employing more than 20 workers 
and who do not observe the law is of €800 for 
each person with disability not employed. As 
already announced this will now be raised to 
€1,600 as of next year.  
These funds will be utilized by the Lino Spiteri 
Foundation 
for 
the 
training 
and 
eventual 
employment of persons with disability, as well as 
the employment of more job coaches to assist both 
persons with disabilities and their employers. 
To further encourage employers to engage 
persons with disability we shall be renewing the 
incentive whereby Government pays the national 
insurance contribution for these employees whilst 
employers are refunded 25% of the wage paid, 
together with a subsidy of €125 a week for three 
years.

12.20  The Malta Council for Economic and Social 
Development 
Government believes that the MCESD should be 
an effective catalyst between the social partners 
and Government.  Consultation within the 
Council leads to concrete recommendations on 
socio-economic issues which then pass on to 
Government for its consideration before taking 
far-reaching 
decisions 
or 
announcing 
any 
reforms.  
 
As 
pledged 
in 
its 
electoral 
programme, 
Government is committed to strengthening the 
Council. At the beginning of the year, the 
Ministry for Social Dialogue, Consumer Affairs 
and Civil Liberties appointed a working group to 
make proposals and recommendations for the 
restructuring of the MCESD and its improved 
operation. 
Once 
Government 
concludes 
its 
assessment of these proposals, it is planned to 
announce a reform of the MCESD early next year. 
This should lead to better communication 
between the social partners in the whole of 
Maltese society and the structures within the 
Council itself, whilst providing a platform for 
each entity in Maltese society to make its voice 
truly heard.

12.21  Setting up of a Human Rights and Equality 
Commission 
In 2014, Government commissioned the drafting 
of two legislative bills. One was to amend the 
current legislation on equality with a view to 
extending this principle to all spheres of life and 
the other concerned the setting up of a National 
Commission for the Promotion of Equality within 
the framework of a National Institute for Human 
Rights, which would be totally autonomous of 
Government and would answer directly to 
Parliament.  These Bills will be moved in the 
coming weeks so that this National Institute could 
be set up next year.  
Concurrently, Government is working on a new 
structure that safeguards equality and human 
rights in its own operations. Final arrangements 
are in hand for the setting up of a Directorate for 
Human Rights and Integration within the 
Ministry for Social Dialogue, Consumer Affairs 
and Civil Liberties. 
 
171 
 
12.22  Voluntary Service 
Next year, Government will proceed with the 
initiatives launched during the past two years, 
including a scheme for stipends to young persons 
who perform voluntary work, and the opening of 
two Voluntary Work Centres, as well as a scheme 
for funding and training programmes.  
Next year a third Centre for Voluntary Work will 
be opened in the South region in fulfilment of our 
electoral promise in this field. 
For 2016 the budget allocation for the voluntary 
sector will about to €335,000.  
 
12.23  Domestic Violence Commission 
The need has long been felt for the operative 
strengthening 
of 
the 
Domestic 
Violence 
Commission. For this purpose, Government will 
next year increase the allocation for this 
Commission to €70,000, almost double what it 
was in 2014. 
This will help this Commission to truly boost its 
endeavours in this field and make sure that 
Maltese 
obligations 
under 
the 
Istanbul 
Convention are respected.
