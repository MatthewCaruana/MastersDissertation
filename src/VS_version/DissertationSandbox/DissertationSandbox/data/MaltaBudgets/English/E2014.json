the Maltese people made a choice.", "They voted for a change of direction in the running of Government.", "They voted for stability.", "The people wanted continuity in all that was working well in the country, but felt the time had come for a fresh and more energetic way to climb out of the bottomless pit of deficits and debts that could drive the country to failure.", "Through the budget for the current year, which the House approved early last April, the new Government was true to its word.", "For the sake of continuity and stability we approved the budget that we were faced with.", "Those who at the time found it hard to understand, today appreciate that stability and the elimination of uncertainty are integral elements through which the country is attracting more investment that creates jobs.", "Today, through this budget Government will be fulfilling its second promise.", "The promise of a change in direction towards sustainable economic growth that benefits all of society.", "The electoral manifesto has now clearly become the Government\u2019s programme.", "Through this budget we will be demonstrating how we shall be accomplishing the first phase of this plan.", "It must be remembered that the reality of Government finances, as we found it, was different from that illustrated by the previous administration.", "It was no surprise to anyone that the country was spending more than it was earning.", "That our country\u2019s credibility with the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the credit rating agencies was almost completely lost.", "That the country had entered a cul-de-sac which a tired Government lacking ideas could not steer it out of.", "This budget was built on a plan.", "It is not an accounting exercise intended to handout funds to one department or another \u201cbecause that was how things were done in the past\u201d.", "Each and every measure in this budget was carefully 2 analyzed, and only those measures more likely to fulfil Government\u2019s highest priorities were selected.", "The first priority is that every expenditure respects the principle that a government should only spend what the country can afford.", "Good governance demands this.", "If we fail to act this way we would be irresponsible, we would cumber our children with additional burdens and ruin our country\u2019s reputation.", "The second priority is to reduce expenditure in the country\u2019s energy production.", "Many did not believe the serious preparations we had in place prior to the elections and thought it was a fairy tale.", "Today we are seeing this becoming a reality.", "The third priority is to expand the potential of our economy allowing the country to achieve the highest possible rate of economic growth so that each Maltese and Gozitan could enjoy a standard of living that does not fall short of that enjoyed in other more developed European countries.", "This can come about by incentivizing those who today are not gainfully occupied to enter the workforce.", "This budget will focus on diligence, on the principle of Making Work Pay.", "The fourth is to curb waste and excessive bureaucracy, which is costing the Government heavily but, even worse, is hampering the initiative of whoever wishes to contribute to economic growth and job creation.", "The fifth is to diversify the country\u2019s economic activity in all manufacturing sectors and services and to extend such activity to all continents prepared to work with us.", "We cannot limit ourselves to any particular sector or a group of countries because this not only limits our growth opportunities but also heightens the risk of dependence on a few select sectors.", "The sixth priority is to place every Government social service on strong and sustainable foundations.", "Education, health, pensions, elderly care, social welfare for families in need and for persons with special needs, the protection of the environment, an efficient judiciary and the enjoyment of 3 family leisure time are what raises the standard of living for the Maltese.", "If we allow these services to become weak we would be sweeping problems under the carpet and fooling ourselves.", "We do all this in the belief that the function of Government is to create an economic and regulatory environment that gives space and facilitates private entrepreneurship and investment.", "We believe that the private sector should be the primary economic motor.", "Our goal is that through this and subsequent budgets, our families should feel an improvement in their standard of living and businesses thrive more than they did before.", "In doing so, we would be creating a Stronger and Fairer Malta.", "ECONOMIC AND FINACIAL BACKGROUND Let us assess where we stand economically and financially.", "Although there are encouraging signs of recovery in the international economy and in the economy of those countries with which Malta has economic ties, international economic and financial instability is not yet over.", "Unemployment is still very high in the Eurozone and economic growth is weak.", "Notwithstanding this and despite the fact that we have been through general elections and a change in government, this year we, very conservatively, anticipate an economic growth of 1.2%, although there is the possibility of a higher growth rate.", ".", "By the second quarter of this year, the country succeeded in increasing jobs by 3%, the biggest growth rate in Europe.", "According to the most recent Eurostat figures, our unemployment rate of 6.4% is amongst the lowest in the European Union.", "This was reflected in an economic growth of 3.6% in the second quarter.", "The rise in the cost of living is gradually slowing down, so much so that where the annual inflation rate in September of last year had stood at 2.9%, inflation dropped to 0.6% in September of this year.", "4 The trend in public finances is encouraging.", "In the first nine months of this year both revenue and expenditure closely matched what had been forecast month by month for this year.", "This was brought about without resorting to disheartening language but through a sense of realism and technical, efficient and silent work.", "All this strengthens the government\u2019s belief that the goal of a 2.7% deficit will be reached this year.", "More detail regarding the economic situation could be found in the Economic Survey.", "This year, together with this Budget Speech we shall be issuing for the first time a publication that explains the budget in further detail.", "FINANCIAL FORECAST For the coming year, we are forecasting an economic growth of around 1.7%.", "This budget is computed on this relatively conservative forecast, despite being higher than the European average.", "Although we are optimistic that economic growth will exceed this forecast, we sought to be prudent.", "This is so despite the fact that international agencies are forecasting that the Maltese economy will grow at a higher rate.", "Usually, Malta is criticised for having overly optimistic forecasts.", "On this occasion, we are more cautious than the agencies.", "It must be noted that for the first time in history, Government\u2019s economic forecasts, which form the basis of a budget, have also been evaluated by the Auditor General.", "FINANCIAL SITUATION In the current year, Government revenue is expected to be just over 3.05 billion Euros.", "Total expenditure is anticipated to reach slightly more than 3.23 billion Euros.", "The deficit in the Consolidated Fund is forecast at 179.8 million Euros.", "We expect to end this year with a deficit of 191.3 million Euros or 2.7% of the Gross Domestic Product.", "Within a few months we have succeeded in going below the 3% threshold.", "More details may be found in Table 1 and Statements A, B and C annexed to this speech.", "5 For next year Government revenue is estimated at a little more than 3.27 billion Euros.", "Total expenditure is expected to be slightly more than 3.41 billion Euros.", "The deficit in the Consolidated Fund is forecast to be 136.3 million Euros.", "During the coming year, the deficit of the extended Government is expected to be of 151.7 million Euros or 2.1% of the Gross Domestic Product.", "Therefore, the deficit will once again be reduced.", "More details as well as the forecasts for the years 2015 and 2016 can be found in Table 2.", "During the coming year, Government is projecting to borrow the sum of 650 million euro.", "Further details regarding the extended Government debt are given in Table 3.", "6 Table 1 7 Table 2 8 Table 3 9 Cost of Living Adjustment In the coming year, the increase in wages to compensate for the rise in the cost of living will be of 3.49 Euros per week.", "This adjustment was worked out according to the mechanism agreed by the social partners.", "In the meantime, work has started on the Household Budgetary Survey leading to an updating of the price index.", "FISCAL ADJUSTMENTS TO ENCOURAGE WORK Revenue Measures In this budget, Government is not introducing any new taxes.", "The speculation from some quarters, intended to instill fear, was unfounded.", "All revenue measures are built on already existing excise duties and which are adjusted in practically every budget.", "Excise duty on cigarettes and tobacco, fuel, cement, alcohol and beer, as well as the tax rate on fuel bunkers are being adjusted.", "A system is being introduced for the recovery of the cost of banderoles.", "Details are given in Tables 1 and 2 annexed to this speech.", "Apart from the duty on fuel, all other excise duties and the tax on fuel bunkering will come into force as of today.", "The excise duty on fuel will become effective on 1st January 2014.", "Although there will be a slight increase in the price of petrol and diesel, I am pleased to announce that the price of diesel will remain the same since we have succeeded in negotiating a stable price between January and March of next year.", "Thus we shall have had a period of six months in which the price of diesel was stable.", "On the other hand, we are still negotiating with regards to petrol and so far we can say that the increase will be of only one Euro cent as of next January.", "This underlines the difference between this Government and the previous administration.", "We do not burden families and businesses with expenses, but work to alleviate their existing burdens because we are on their side..", "That is how stability is achieved.", "10 As of 1st January, car licensing will be modified as shown in Annex 3 of this speech; however licenses for small cars registered after 2009 with CO2 emissions of between 0 and 100 grams shall remain unchanged.", "It is estimated that these changes will yield an increase of around 21.4 million Euros in Government revenue.", "Investment in Infrastructure We are allocating the sum of circa 453 million Euros for a capital works programme; an increase of almost 66 million Euros when compared to the previous budget allocation..", "This allocation excludes the sum of 15 million earmarked for the strengthening the capital base of Air Malta..", "Apart from the continuation of projects in progress, this allocation will cover new projects to be launched during the coming year.", "11.7 million Euros are being allocated to tertiary education institutions for the continuation of projects at the University and MCAST and the subvention to the Foundation for Tomorrow\u2019s Schools to continue the MCAST building as well as new schools.", "We are investing 2.5 million Euros in the Marsa sports complex and football and water polo facilities in Bir\u017cebbu\u0121a.", "We will be investing 96.4 million Euros in infrastructure and another 59 million Euros for the protection of the environment.", "We have increased the allocation for road building.", "The various other economic sectors of our country will also be sustained through an allocation of 48.5 million Euros.", "A number of projects in the energy and water industries are being allocated 20.7 million Euros.", "Health is being given priority in our capital investment programme.", "We have increased the allocation for this sector to 60.8 million Euros compared to the 52 million Euros allocated last year.", "Cuts in the Highest Rate of Income Tax We turn now to a series of cuts in or complete removal of taxes and other positive measures \u2013 because this government will not wait until the eve of 11 the next elections to start implementing the proposals put before the people and which were resoundingly approved.", "As pledged we will again cut income tax rates.", "The personal tax rate of 32% applicable to those earning less than sixty thousand Euros will once again be reduced to 29%.", "This applies to all computations: single, married and parent.", "This measure will cost 13.2 million Euros.", "As was originally planned when this measure was introduced, income from dividends received by individuals will remain taxable at the same rates applicable prior to the introduction of the marginal rate of 32%.", "This measure is necessary to ensure the sustainability of personal tax rate cuts.", "Tax Cuts for the Middle Class This might come as a surprise to some but we will be cutting income tax even further.", "This Government does not want to help only high earners or persons on the minimum wage.", "We want to build a new middle class and for this reason we will be helping those families earning more than the minimum wage but who do not earn so much as to feel well-off.", "For this reason we will be introducing an income tax rate cut for middle class families.", "The tax band for parent computation will be widened from 9,300 Euros to 9,800 Euros.", "This means that parents with children will not be liable to tax on the first 9,800 Euros earned and will be saving 75 Euros in income tax annually.", "This measure is estimated to cost 1.8 million Euros.", "Another adjustment is being made in the computation through which parents can qualify for the parent computation.", "The age of offspring in tertiary education maintained by their parents is being raised from 21 to 23 and in addition the term tertiary education is being widened to include colleges and other educational institution (e.g.", "MCAST, ITS) so that parents who send their children to these institutions would also qualify.", "In this way, we would be expressing our appreciation for those families who encourage their children to further their studies.", "12 Extension of the Preferential Income Tax Rate on Part-Time Work.", "We are reducing tax on part-time work.", "The ceiling (of the amount liable to the preferential rate of 15%) is being raised from 7,000 Euros to 10,000 Euros in case of part-time employees and 12,000 Euros in case of part-time self employed individuals.", "Incentive for Self-Employed Part-Time Work So as to encourage the transition from full-time employment to full-time self-employment, owners of part-time businesses will be allowed to employ up to two part-time workers without forfeiting their entitlement to the 15% tax rate.", "The present system does not allow part-time business owners to employ workers and expand their business.", "This makes it difficult for them to leave their full-time jobs.", "We are doing this because this is a hard working Government that wants to promote diligence.", "Exemption of the Minimum Wage from Tax Liability This Government is far different from the previous one.", "It will not tax minimum wage earners.", "The ceiling (currently at \u20ac8,950) will be raised to account for the COLA so that persons earning no more than the minimum wage will be completely exempt from income tax.", "Exemption of Pensioners from Income Tax We will be going even a step further.", "13 From next year, this measure will be extended even to those pensioners whose income derives only from a pension that does not exceed the minimum wage.", "Extension of the 15% Income Tax Rate to Self-Employed Pensioners Pensioners who are also self-employed on a part-time basis will henceforth benefit from a preferential income tax rate of 15% on their income as long as it does not exceed the minimum income on which they pay the lowest rate of social security contribution.", "Reduced Income Tax Rate (7.5%) on Part-Time Work for Footballers.", "We want to introduce more professionalism in sport.", "Following discussion with the MFA and in light of new international regulations, this year we will commence with football.", "We want this sport to become more legitimate and to come out of the black economy which is fertile ground for corruption.", "For this reason, we shall be decreasing income tax on income derived from football to 7.5%.", "This measure should encourage conformity and provides an incentive to those who choose professional football as their career.", "We are hoping that with the help of the MFA, clubs will conform and enter into the legitimate economy.", "Tax on Transfers in Sales by Auction Tax on transfers following sales by auction will be removed completely.", "Limit on Interest Due on Duty Causa Mortis At the current time the interest paid on duty due by the transferee causa mortis is not subject to any ceiling and the interest could exceed the amount of duty due.", "Henceforth, interest shall not exceed the amount of duty due..", "This translates into savings for the heirs.", "14 15% Withholding Tax on Rent Government wants to further incentivise the rental market whilst regulating it more efficiently.", "Persons deriving income from the lease of residential property shall have the option to apply a 15% final withholding tax calculated on the gross income from such leases which will effectively mean a tax reduction.", "This measure is intended to induce conformity in the rental market.", "The Income Tax Department will be strengthening enforcement in this sector.", "Undeclared leases will be subject to a final tax of 35% calculated on the gross income apart from other penalties and interest that will be imposed.", "Now everyone will have the opportunity to declare rental income at a fair rate.", "Evasion will not be tolerated.", "Exemption for First Time Buyers We want to help young couples to acquire their first residence.", "At the current time a duty of 3.5% is due on the first 150,000 Euros with respect to property bought as a first residence.", "A one-time concession is being given to those persons who never owned any immovable property prior to January 2014, either directly or indirectly, and who will be entering a final contract during the year 2014.", "This measure is expected to boost the property market and means a saving of up to 5,250 Euros for young buyers on the acquisition of their first residence.", "Removal of the Government Architect System Government will be implementing a change in the system of property evaluation through its own architects.", "For tax purposes, Government will be accepting valuations by any ex parte architect, but safeguards will be introduced to curb abuse.", "Pilot Project on Government Property in Valletta This Government wishes to have a clear indication of all the property it owns.", "It is unacceptable that there is so much data scattered around without a having a centralized system.", "15 For this reason, a pilot project will be initiated in Valletta so that Government would have a precise knowledge of its properties in the Capital.", "This will also be useful in protecting national treasures from falling into disrepair and in indentifying opportunities for investment even in conjunction with the private sector, as witnessed by the response following the recent Government properties put on the market.", "We believe there are enormous opportunities in Valletta and other localities.", "Simplification of Dispositions in VAT and Income Tax Legislation As part of the merger of the tax departments, we drafted amendments intended to simplify various dispositions in the VAT and Income Tax Acts.", "This will simplify operations and conformity with fiscal laws.", "The current system of VAT appropriation has led to very high interest charges and accumulations of penalties/arrears which make life very difficult for defaulting taxpayers.", "At present, payments are first set off against the oldest balances and are first appropriated against interests and penalties.", "As of next January, when VAT returns are submitted in time, together with the payment, the amount so paid shall not be deemed to set off old balances due.", "This encourages conformity and helps taxpayers who could not conform due to liquidity problems.", "In other words, government will be helping genuine businesses to pay their fair share without adding new burdens.", "Provisions will be introduced in the Value Added Tax Act regarding tax in dispute.", "Currently, when an assessment is issued, payments are allocated to VAT due even for the VAT period which is still subject to appeal (not final and conclusive).", "Provisions regarding tax in dispute will be introduced in the VAT Act to ensure that payments made are not set off against tax which is in dispute.", "16 The VAT Act currently deems a VAT return as not having been submitted if the amount due is not paid in full.", "This results in an accumulation of penalties for non-filing even when a VAT return is in fact submitted.", "This penalty will be removed, thus encouraging more businesses to conform.", "The prescribed rate of interest, both under the Value Added Tax Act and the Income Tax Act, on tax payable/refundable will be reduced and will henceforth be flexible.", "Offences under the Income Tax Act Currently, when a person is found guilty of an offence under any of the dispositions of the Income Tax Act and is not condemned to imprisonment for that offence, the Court mandatorily warns the offender that if within five years from the date of the warning, he/she is once again found guilty of another offence, he/she would be liable, apart from any other penalty, to not less than three days imprisonment.", "This means that, at present, the Court has no other option but to condemn the person to imprisonment in the case of a second offence.", "We look upon the self-employed as essential partners in the economy.", "We shall be firm against evaders, but we believe that the circumstances of recent years have forced genuine self-employed persons into difficult situations.", "We want to see the imprisonment of the self-employed for nonpayment of VAT on time as being the exception not the rule.", "The law will be amended so that the Court, in the case of a second offence, will have the discretion to choose between imprisonment or an imposition of a \u20ac2,000 fine.", "Measures against Tax Evasion Government will keep fighting tax evasion.", "This is because evasion erodes the sustainability of services like free health and education and the social benefits the state provides.", "But worse than that, tax evasion throws heavier burdens on those who are honest.", "17 We shall therefore launch a campaign against fiscal evasion to make it clear to everyone that there is no place for evasion in a developed and democratic society.", "We want to assist the construction industry which we believe to be important for the country.", "But we will be ensuring that all taxes due are paid.", "We shall be introducing a system whereby whoever purchases a service in the property industry, for instance construction works where the purchaser is unable to substantiate the work performed, will be liable to pay the VAT due.", "Investment Registration Scheme More countries are sharing information and the Maltese Government, together with other European states, will soon be in possession of all details concerning undeclared money and investments.", "We will be launching an Investment Registration Scheme whereby persons who have undeclared cash, stocks and investments either in Malta or abroad, and who wish to regularize their position will be able to do so against a fair fine.", "The details of the Investment Registration Scheme will be published shortly.", "Level Playing Field in Business We will be taking steps against foreign individuals who come to work in Malta without respecting regulations.", "Government is in favour of competition, but such competition must be fair.", "It is unacceptable that a Maltese businessman who pays income tax, social security contributions, VAT and eco-contribution is faced with competition from businessmen who pay nothing and do not contribute their share.", "We will be establishing an online system to facilitate the reporting of such abuse.", "18 European Union Presidency and European Funds The Presidency of the European Union, in the first six months of 2017 is a key national challenge.", "Therefore, we shall be facing this commitment on a bi-partisan level.", "We have already started allocating funds for training.", "The coming year is the first year of the Multi-Annual Financial Framework 2014-2020.", "Malta\u2019s three financial priorities are: (1) strengthening competitiveness, (2) the support of the economy and (3) more investment in people.", "Priority will also be given to education, research, innovation, energy, job creation and access to finance for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises.", "CHEAPER AND GREENER ENERGY This Government does not pretend to be perfect.", "But one imperfection it does not have is reneging on pledges made.", "We promised to reduce water and electricity bills.", "That is exactly what we will do.", "In March 2014 we will fulfil our electoral pledge and will be reducing electricity and water bills by an average of 25% and 5% respectively for households.", "The reduction in utility bills will leave more money in people\u2019s pockets.", "This reduction will have a strong and positive impact on the Maltese economy.", "Alice in Wonderland will be leaving over 25 million Euro in families\u2019 pockets.", "However, this will not adversely affect the public finances.", "The plan to efficiently reduce utility bills by the prescribed deadline is on track following the confidence shown in the project by large international consortia.", "If it were up to others you would have continued paying exorbitant tariffs for water and electricity.", "19 This Government is the consumers\u2019 guarantor of cheaper bills.", "Whilst reducing tariffs we shall be converting to gas, which is far better for health and the environment.", "Meanwhile a study was launched into the feasibility of a gas pipeline.", "Phase two of the plan is the reduction in tariffs for businesses in 2015.", "This is how things should be done efficiently.", "Sound Foundations for Enemalta We are implementing a plan to place Enemalta Corporation on a sound financial foundation.", ".", "Government shall be implementing a plan to ensure an adequate, sustainable and secure electricity supply.", "This plan is already being reinforced following an agreement with Libya for the provision of oil and gas at advantageous prices as well as direct investment in Enemalta by China Power Investments and Shangai Electric.", "This is a plan that will save Enemalta from the disastrous situation it was left in, safeguard the jobs of the corporation\u2019s employees and open up new markets.", "Moreover, ARMS must substantially improve its service.", "Price Stability Whenever possible, Government is adopting a policy of price stability for petrol, diesel as well as gas.", "As already announced, the price of these three fuels will remain unchanged till the end of the year.", "In the case of diesel, the price will remain stable until next March.", "20 Malta Oil and Gas Corporation To create an infrastructural framework for the development of the service sector in the oil and gas industry, the Malta Oil and Gas Corporation will be

investment in clean energy such as that generated by photovoltaic panels.", "The National Renewable Energy Action Plan is being revised enabling Government to identify those policies and measures necessary to reach the mandatory targets in renewable energy.", "Intelligent Lighting Pilot Project An intelligent street lighting pilot project will be carried out in Gozo together with another 12 kilometers of roads in Malta.", "This project, co-\n financed by European funds, is expected to cost 2.8 million Euros.", "Through this project, existing street lamps will be replaced by others that are energy saving, having a life of at least 60,000 hours and are capable of a dimming effect.", "The aim is eventually to extend this project to replace all street lighting in the country.", "This latter project, also co-financed through European funds is expected to cost 5.4 million Euro.", "The electrical system in Ru\u017car Briffa Block at the St Vincent de Paule Residence will also be replaced by a more efficient system to reduce future costs.", "This project, co-financed by the European Union is expected to cost 6 million Euro.", "Retro Fitting in Buildings Energy audits have been carried out in various public buildings.", "We shall be promoting a programme of Retro Fitting in various buildings to render them more energy efficient.", "Buildings consume 40% of all energy
