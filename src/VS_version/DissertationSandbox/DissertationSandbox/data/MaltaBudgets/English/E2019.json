Mr Speaker, This is the second budget of the new legislature, which began in June last year, when the people of Malta and Gozo once again confirmed their trust in this Government with another historic win for the Labour Government.", "This is also the seventh budget since 2013, which I am presenting.", "From the very beginning, this Government was steadfast in its vision to see our country ranked among the best countries in the European Union, both in economic terms and in terms of a more just and merciful society.", "We have created a strategy, laid out a plan and worked ceaselessly in order to make this happen in the shortest period of time possible.", "It is my honour and pleasure to say that this vision has not only become a reality, but has become so widely accepted that it is being taken for granted.", "Year after year, month after month, we continue to achieve more positive results.", "This can be seen in: the economic growth, increase in employment, reduction in unemployment, including youth unemployment, surplus in the fiscal balance, and in the country\u2019s external trade balance, an increase in investment by Maltese people as well as foreigners, more innovation, higher private consumption, an 2 increase in exports and in the tourism sector, including an increase in the number of flight routes to Malta, the lowering of the national debt and the creation of a sizeable Fund with the purpose of social investment for our children.", "This contrasts greatly with other European countries, where Malta is often ranked in first place, as well as, with the none too stable situation prior to 2013, where Malta was subject to the European Union\u2019s excessive deficit procedure, as well as, another procedure due to macroeconomic instability.", "Mr Speaker, each of this Government\u2019s budgets, including this one, is a link in a chain of progress, but is also, in itself, the commencement of a new phase.", "Therefore, it is good that before going ahead, we stop and take a look at where our country is today, where the Maltese family is today.", "Chances are that in many families today, one can find members that up until recently were unemployed, for one reason or another.", "Nowadays, they are gainfully employed.", "Most of these people were women or youths who have benefitted from budgetary measures including free Child Care, the Breakfast Club, Afternoon School Services, the Maternity Leave Fund, and fiscal incentives in the case of women, as well as, specialised training and apprenticeship schemes for young people, so that at any given time, 3 they can be either in an educational institution, engaged in on-the-job training, or in employment.", "Low-income families now have the opportunity to enter the tapering programme, benefit from the In-work Benefit and where applicable, from social benefits such as rent subsidies.", "These measures have led us to achieve the highest historical labour force participation rate ever registered in our country, of 71 per cent.", "This is why, at the same time, we have attained an unprecedented decrease in the number of people looking for work and in the number of people on social aid.", "At the same time, we sheltered and supported those who due to illness or disability cannot enter the labour force, low-income families, the elderly and pensioners.", "This led to a substantial decrease in poverty, with the percentage of families suffering from material deprivation falling from 20 per cent in 2012 to 8 per cent in 2017.", "This did not happen by chance.", "It is fine and normal that when a family reaches higher standards of living, they start raising their expectations, cherishing more than ever their health, the investment in the education of their children, the cleanliness of the environment surrounding them and above all, a higher quality of life.", "4 That is why, Mr Speaker, with a strong economy that is leaving more money in the pockets of families and with sustainable public finances, we will be introducing measures aimed at continuing to improve the quality of life for our families.", "During all this, the Government will ensure that public finances remain sustainable by continuing to register, for a third year, a surplus in the public finances.", "At the same time, the Government will keep its promise to decrease the burden of taxes on Maltese and Gozitan families, so much so, that this budget, for the second year in a row, will not introduce any new taxes, direct or indirect.", "1.1 The economic and financial context Mr Speaker, during the year 2017, the Maltese economy grew by 6.7 per cent in real terms, while in the first six months of this year, it grew by 5.4 per cent.", "This compares very well with the average growth rate of 2.2 per cent registered in the European Union.", "During the first half of this year, this growth was primarily driven by consumption and investment.", "Private consumption increased by 6.0 per cent.", "In a year\u2019s time, this translates to a substantial increase of \u20ac700 million with half of the increase going in wages and salaries and the other half in company profits.", "5 Economic growth continued to be diversified during the first half of this year, as all sectors, including manufacturing and retail, registered increases in the Gross Value Added.", "All throughout last year, the labour market in our country remained dynamic, with a record increase in employment.", "In fact, the number of people who were employed exceeded the 200,000 mark, while when it came to unemployment, we registered a record low rate of 3.8 per cent in August, while youth unemployment fell to 8.8 per cent in the same period.", "The private sector continued to be the primary driver of employment, generating 90 per cent of new jobs.", "We continued to achieve success even in the external trade sector, where the country\u2019s current account registered a surplus of 12.8 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the second quarter of the year.", "Mr Speaker, I would now like to look at our country\u2019s public finances (see tables 1.1, 1.2.", "and 1.3).", "I confirm that according to the latest statistics, this year will be the third consecutive year which will end with a surplus in the fiscal balance.", "6 The same applies when it comes to the Public Debt.", "We have not only reached our target of lowering it to below 60 per cent, but we have gone beyond it, so much so that debt is now approaching 47 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product.", "This way, we are continuing to ensure the sustainability of the country\u2019s public finances.", "1.2 The economic and fiscal projections The International Monetary Fund revised its outlook for global growth downwards to 3.7 per cent.", "This reflects the negative risks and uncertainties present in international business, due to the introduction of tariffs and Brexit.", "The economies of the European Union and the Eurozone are expected to grow by 2.0 per cent.", "This is due to the same uncertainties and risks that we have just mentioned.", "For our country, we predict that economic growth will remain strong, with a growth rate of 5.3 per cent in real terms, and 7.7 per cent in nominal terms.", "Growth is expected to continue to be driven by an 8.4 per cent increase in investment and a 4.1 per cent increase in private consumption.", "This will lead to a 3.7 per cent increase in employment and 7 an expected low unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent.", "The inflation rate is expected to be 1.9 per cent.", "In the international trade sector, we predict a 2.2 per cent growth in exports for next year.", "This growth reflects the expected increase in exports from various sectors, which include, amongst others, the financial sector, the gaming sector and the tourism sector.", "For 2019, we are predicting another surplus of 1.3 per cent, while the burden of debt is expected to continue decreasing to 43.8 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product.", "Table 1.1\n \u20ac '000\n \u20ac '000\n \u20ac '000\n \u20ac '000\n \u20ac '000\n Table 1.1E english proj\n 21/10/2018 13:18\n

WEALTH\n Mr Speaker, this is a Government that fulfils its promises.", "This applies to the distribution of wealth as a result of economic growth.", "This budget will continue to demonstrate how prosperity will reach everyone.", "2.1 The Cost of Living Adjustment The Cost of Living Adjustment, which is calculated according to a formula agreed on by all social partners within the MCESD, reflects an inflation rate of 1.08 per cent for the established period.", "The increase for next year will be \u20ac2.33 per week.", "This increase will be given to all employees, as well as pensioners and those on social benefits.", "Students will be benefitting from this adjustment pro-rata, so that stipends will increase once again.", "2.2 An additional day of vacation leave During this year, we started implementing the electoral promise to give back to the workers the public holidays that fall on a weekend, which others took from them without consultation.", "Therefore, during next year, we will add another day of vacation leave.", "12 2.3 Salary adjustment for employees earning Minimum Wage Last year, a historical agreement was reached between the Government and social partners, unions, as well as employers, on how the National Minimum Wage should be supplemented.", "This agreement stipulated that employees on the minimum wage should receive a raise after a year of employment with the same employer.", "The employee is entitled to an increase of \u20ac3 a week during the second year of employment and an additional \u20ac3 per week in the third year of employment.", "Employees earning more than the basic minimum wage will be entitled to a part of the raise in the second and third year of employment.", "This means that all workers earning minimum wage in 2017 will this year be given a raise of \u20ac3 per week and next year will be given another raise of \u20ac3 per week.", "2.4 Increase in the Children\u2019s Allowance for families with an income under \u20ac20,000 Mr Speaker, for the first time in 11 years (and in certain cases in 23 years), we will be increasing Children\u2019s Allowances to families with a gross income of less than \u20ac20,000 per year.", "13 The highest rate of Children\u2019s Allowance will rise to reach a maximum of \u20ac96 per year for each child.", "It is estimated that in total, 24,600 boys and girls from 16,500 families will benefit from this increase.", "This measure will cost \u20ac2 million per year.", "More information is available in Table 2.1.", "2.5 Further reduction in taxes for all employed persons Last month, we started fulfilling the promise we made to continue reducing taxes on work.", "I have the pleasure of announcing that the tax refund that was given this year will once again be given next year.", "This measure will cost Government \u20ac11.5 million and over 200,000 people who are in the labour market will benefit from it.", "(See table 2.2) 2.6 Adjusting the tax exemption cap for single persons Employees who are registered as \u201csingle persons\u201d for tax purposes and whose income coming from part-time jobs exceeds the \u20ac9,100 ceiling, but does not exceed the minimum wage will not be taxed anymore.", "This measure is aimed at addressing an anomaly.", "14 2.7 Self-employed persons with a new right to compensation in case of unemployment We will amend the Social Security law so that for the first time in our country, self-employed persons who for some reason have to cease their activity and start registering for work, will start having the right to receive unemployment benefits according to the contributions that they have paid.", "In this way, we will be removing the discrimination that exists between employees and people who are self-employed.", "2.8 Benefits for members of the security forces in the case of accidents on the workplace Throughout the past year, work has been carried out on a regulatory framework to introduce a number of benefits that will be given to all members of the security forces who work in the public sector.", "These benefits will be given in the case of a fatal accident or a permanent disability which prohibits the individual affected from working.", "I am pleased to announce that further details about these benefits and how they will be introduced will be given to the employees concerned after the final consultations are carried out.", "15 2.9 Increase in Medical Assistance As of next year, we will be increasing the non-contributory Medical Assistance by \u20ac5.14 per week for married couples who are both suffering from chronic illness and receiving this Assistance.", "This increase comes as a result of the difference in the rates paid, which persists to this day, between the first adult and the second adult.", "This way, each adult in the family receives the same amount of money.", "The people who will benefit most from this measure are elderly couples who both suffer from chronic illness and are thus eligible.", "2.10 Increase in pensions Mr Speaker, I will now focus on pensions.", "While they were forgotten for the entirety of 25 years, in the past three years we have introduced various measures for a wide range of pensioners which has resulted in pensions starting to be increased once again.", "Mr Speaker, next year, for the fourth year in a row, we will be raising pensions once again.", "In 2019, we will be giving an increase of \u20ac2.17 to all social security pensions, namely retirement pensions, widows pensions, invalidity pensions, as well as, old age pensions.", "This increase will be apart from the 16 Cost of Living Adjustment increase.", "This way, each pensioner will be receiving an increase of \u20ac4.50 per week.", "More than 92,000 pensioners will be benefitting from this measure.", "This measure will cost \u20ac10 million.", "2.11 Increase in the tax exemption cap on pensions Once again, we will be increasing the tax exemption cap on the maximum income for pensions, so that the increase in pensions, including the COLA increase, will not be taxed.", "The cap will be increased to \u20ac13,434 (See table 2.3.).", "2.12 Service pensions As has been done in previous years, about 4,500 service pensioners will once again receive another \u20ac200 raise to their service pension amount, which is deducted from the social security pension, so that the total exempted will go up to \u20ac2,466.", "However, Mr Speaker, this time we will not stop here.", "One of the electoral promises we had made was to continue improving service pensions by exempting entirely from the social security pension the part of the pension that had been commutated in order to receive the lump sum.", "17 As of next year, as a first step towards the fulfilment of this electoral promise, pensioners who receive a service pension and who are 72 years old or older, or who will reach this age next year, will have their social security pensions revised.", "This way, instead of exempting half the amount of the service pension that had been commutated, as of next year, 75 per cent of the amount commutated will be exempted.", "In the first year of the fulfilment of this measure, it is estimated that around 2,200 pensioners will start benefiting from an average increase of around \u20ac11 per week in their social security pensions.", "As time goes by, more service pensioners will be benefitting from this measure, especially those who receive a lower service pension than others.", "2.13 \u20ac300 annual grant The \u20ac300 annual grant given to the elderly aged 75 years and over and are still living in their home, will again be provided in 2018.", "More than 29,000 elderly men and women benefit from this grant, which costs \u20ac9 million.", "2.14 Bonus for those who paid contributions but do not receive a pension In the 2014 budget, we introduced for the first time a bonus that started being paid out each year to a number of persons, mostly women who did 18 not pay enough contributions to qualify for a minimum pension.", "From the 1st of January onwards, we will be increasing this bonus by \u20ac50.", "This way, those who paid more than a year\u2019s contributions, but fewer than 5 years\u2019 contributions, will see their bonus increase to \u20ac200, while the bonus for those who paid more than five years\u2019 contributions will increase to \u20ac300 per year.", "Around 12,500 people will benefit from this measure.", "2.15 Further incentives for people to remain in the workforce Three years ago, we introduced an incentive to encourage people to continue working beyond their retirement age, by increasing the pension they would receive when they turn 65 years old.", "This incentive was available to the private sector.", "From next year, this incentive will gradually be extended to public sector employees, as long as the employee requests it and the employer gives their consent.", "2.16 Past injustices will continue to be addressed Mr Speaker, over the past two years I have established a fund which can be used to pay for anomalies which may have been created over the years due to changes in the pensions system, or for other reasons.", "19 For the third year in a row, we will allocate \u20ac11 million in funds to address past injustices, which affect more than 6,000 beneficiaries, or their heirs.", "Throughout next year, the process to pay pension arrears to former employees of the Malta Electricity Board or their heirs will be concluded.", "2.17 Government Savings Bonds for pensioners After the overwhelming demand in the past two years for the issuing of the 62+ Savings Bonds reserved for individuals aged 62 years and over, which saw more than 14,000 pensioners participating in the issuing of these Bonds, we will once again be issuing a similar Bond next year, since interest rates on fixed bank accounts have remained low.", "Over 6,300 new pensioners will be eligible for this issuing.", "2.18 More aid for people with disabilities Mr Speaker, people with disabilities have always been a priority for this Government.", "Throughout the last legislature, as well as, the present one, we have introduced various measures, including the right for people with disabilities to work, substantial improvements in disability pensions, the building of homes for independent living and the establishment of a Disability Trust Fund.", "During 2019, we will continue introducing other measures to help people with disabilities integrate within society.", "We are going to carry out 20 another phase of the Disability Assistance reforms, which were started last year and which included the introduction of Additional Assistance for Severe Disability, for persons who absolutely cannot work and who will eventually be receiving the equivalent of the minimum wage.", "Consequently, from the coming January, the weekly assistance payment will increase from \u20ac140 to \u20ac150 per week.", "Apart from that, the scheme will be extended to 600 other people who will be granted the dignity they deserve.", "Besides the Barthel Index, which applies to people with mobility problems, an Impairment Rating Evaluation will be used as well.", "Further details will be shared in the coming weeks.", "2.19 An increase in the Disabled Child Allowance We will be increasing the children\u2019s allowance paid out to parents whose children suffer from some form of physical or mental disability.", "In 2014, we had already increased this allowance from \u20ac16.31 to \u20ac20 per week.", "From next year, this allowance will increase by another \u20ac5 to \u20ac25 per week.", "Around 1,400 children with disabilities and their families will benefit from this increase.", "21 2.20 Enhancing the Increased Carers\u2019 Allowance In the last two Budgets, we improved the payments for those who look after the elderly in their own homes.", "This was done through the reform of the Increased Allowance for Carers, which went up to \u20ac140 and the Allowance for Carers that went up to \u20ac90.", "As from January, the exemption from the means test will apply to both allowances.", "This gives more elderly people the possibility of living in their homes and in their communities, since their relatives who look after them will start benefitting from this as well.", "With this measure, even married persons, until they reach pensionable age, who live under the same roof with the elderly man or woman, will be eligible for the Allowance for Carers.", "Apart from that, as of next year, when a person applies to start looking after an elderly person who has reached the age of 85, they will no longer need to undergo a medical evaluation from the multidisciplinary board and the allowance will be paid automatically, if the carer and the elderly person live in the same home.", "22 2.21 Increasing the fiscal incentives for private pensions Throughout the past four years, we have given incentives to individuals who invest in a private pension known as the Third Pillar Pension Scheme, as well as, to employers who decide to offer a voluntary pension scheme which is non-contributory from the employee\u2019s side \u2013 here, I am referring to the Voluntary Occupational Pension Scheme.", "Next year, there will be improvements in these two schemes, where we will increase the amount of tax-exempt annual financial investment to a maximum of \u20ac2,000 each year.", "Apart from that, the reduction in taxes will be increasing from 15 per cent to 25 per cent.", "Both the employees and the employers will benefit from the increases in these fiscal incentives.", "2.22 Tax refunds for those who send their children to independent schools We have started providing free school transport for children who attend independent schools and church schools.", "However, we know that independent schools have increased their fees and tariffs, for a number of reasons, including higher overheads, as well as, because Government has improved conditions for teachers.", "Parents who send their children to independent schools now benefit from tax deductions on fees paid.", "As of next year, the Government shall 23 increase this tax deduction to \u20ac1,600 per year for each child that attends a kindergarten centre, \u20ac1,900 per year for each child that attends primary school, and \u20ac2,600 per year for each child attending secondary school, an addition of \u20ac300 for each child.", "(See Table 2.4) 2.23 Grant on the purchase and installation of Reverse Osmosis systems at home Mr Speaker, we will be issuing a grant equivalent to a tax refund on the purchase and installation of equipment that purifies water in the

and written about rental rates and property prices, and many suggestions have been put forward on how this sector should be addressed.", "It\u2019s a fact that the economic success that our country is benefitting from has brought with it new challenges, stemming from the demand for social housing and affordable housing.", "This Government is committed to addressing this problem, and not avoiding it.", "In this Budget, we will start introducing a number of measures, incentivising the property owner, as well as, the tenant in order to make rent prices more affordable without disturbing the market.", "Mr Speaker, I would like to point out that Malta is one of the few countries where the majority of families are homeowners.", "Therefore, we estimate that around 78 per cent of Maltese families are seeing an appreciation in their family assets as property values rise.", "On the other hand, the Government will continue to safeguard the interests of people who are renting, or who require social accommodation.", "31 Last week, we launched a White Paper on Renting as a Housing Alternative, which is now open for consultation.", "The White Paper proposes that contracts should cover an established period that the registration of rent contracts should be obligatory, that a minimum notice period for both property owners and tenants should be established, that there should be more enforcement against irregularities and abuse, as well as, more efficiency when it comes to resolving disputes.", "What the White Paper on rent is proposing reflects the fact that the private rent sector has changed from how it was in the past.", "The reforms being proposed in the White Paper are aimed at adding stability to the rental market, so that families who live in rented homes can live without uncertainty, making the sector more transparent and strengthening the relationship between the person who rents and the property owner, so that whoever invests in property will keep on making a fair and deserved profit.", "3.1 Rent Benefit \u2013 social housing and affordable housing As of next year, there will be a radical change in how financial aid will be given to make rent more affordable.", "First of all, the means test on the assets that the applicant holds will be removed.", "Instead, there will be two criteria for eligibility.", "The first is the gross family income, which includes wages and interests, and which does not exceed the established benchmark.", "The second is that the existing rent paid exceeds the 32 benchmark for that family.", "The applicant will be eligible if they fall under both criteria.", "Financial aid ranges from \u20ac3,000 to a maximum of \u20ac5,000 per year, according to the family\u2019s circumstances.", "Further details will be given when the scheme is introduced.", "We estimate that for next year the financial assistance provided will reach up to \u20ac5 million.", "3.2 Incentive scheme for owners renting out their property at moderate prices over a long-term period Conscious of the important role that property owners have in the rental sector when it comes to affordable housing, the Government is in discussions to launch a scheme granting fiscal incentives to property owners by reducing the taxes on the sale of a property, in the case of an affordable rent, for a period of seven years.", "3.3 Equity Sharing scheme People who have turned 40 years old are finding it very difficult to purchase a home, since it is hard for them to acquire a loan from the bank.", "Throughout this year, discussions with banks were launched to find a solution to this problem.", "Therefore, next year we will be launching a scheme for people who have turned 40 and are interested in buying a home.", "As long as they can pay no less than half the value of the property, it will be possible for the bank to loan them the rest of the expense, which the person will pay back over a number of years.", "However, Government 33 will be paying interest to the bank throughout the period that the person will have committed to paying back the loan.", "3.4 Social Housing This Government believes that the State is responsible for the functioning of social housing.", "In this regard, while work is currently being carried out on a 500-\n apartment project with the help of the European Investment Bank and the European Council Development Bank, work will also start on the building of nearly 700 additional social housing units, an investment of \u20ac50 million, with part of the investment coming from the National Development and Social Fund.", "Apart from that, the Government will continue creating initiatives to continue increasing the stock of Government housing.", "3.5 Regeneration of dilapidated property A number of Government properties in a dilapidated state have been identified, which can be refurbished for use as social housing.", "34 3.6 Special projects Next year, the Housing Authority will be evaluating two pilot projects which will be carried out in conjunction with non-governmental entities.", "While the Housing Authority will be funding part of the expense for such property to be refurbished, it will be entering in an arrangement with the non-governmental entity so that the property may be used for the purpose of social housing, with lower rent prices than one would find on the market.", "3.7 Regeneration of Housing Estates In the coming months, the Housing Authority will continue its work on maintenance or embellishment programmes, according to the needs of each particular block.", "The embellishment programme will also continue in the Government housing blocks.", "3.8 Reorganisation of the Housing Authority The Housing Authority will be carrying out an internal reorganisation in order to take on all the challenges in the housing sector, when it comes to affordable social housing.", "In this regard, the Authority will be launching within it a Unit focusing on property registration, owner protection and regulatory enforcement.", "35 3.9 The extension of existing schemes Mr Speaker, I am pleased to announce that the existing schemes which we introduced in past years will be extended for another year.", "These are the stamp duty reduction for first-time buyers, second-time buyers, vacant properties in Urban Conservation Areas, purchasing of property in Gozo, as well as, refunds for expenses incurred through restoration work.", "3.10 Equity Release Facilities I am also pleased to announce that the work carried out by the Home Equity Release working group has been completed.", "This will allow pensioners to raise their annual financial income, allowing them to improve their standard of living.", "Further details will be announced in the coming weeks.", "36 4.", "ADDRESSING ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE\n This year, the Government continued to clearly demonstrate its commitment towards carrying out its ambitious plan for roadworks and road maintenance to be carried out in a proper, efficient and timely manner.", "Such investment is unprecedented.", "Anyone who makes use of our roads may notice how various junctions were widened in order to allow traffic to circulate better.", "The Kappara project had barely been inaugurated when works commenced in preparation for the Marsa Junction project.", "Mr Speaker, last year I had also mentioned that we will start addressing the problem of traffic congestion.", "I stated that this was an important issue that needs to be addressed over a number of years, through the introduction of various incentives, in order to gradually phase out the dependence on private cars.", "The incentives we introduced encouraging the use of bicycles and motorcycles and the use of public or collective transport, while discouraging the use of private cars, are already showing signs that the strategy is working.", "37 This Government will continue working so that these traffic-related challenges will continue to be overcome, thus reducing air pollution and improving the quality of life.", "4.1 Ongoing road projects The \u20ac700 million plan to upgrade all the roads in this country, including in Gozo, over a period of seven years, has begun.", "Next year, we are planning to carry out roadworks with an investment of \u20ac100 million.", "This clearly shows the importance that this Government is giving to this sector.", "Moreover, the amount voted for roadworks is four times the amount that used to be voted before.", "The projects are progressing at an accelerated pace and the works are being carried out to high standards.", "Therefore, we are confident that the roads scheduled to be carried out throughout next year will all be completed in the stipulated time period.", "The Government understands the criticism that is often made about the need to marry better the needful development of the roads with the protection of green zones, and the retention of trees.", "Therefore, Infrastructure Malta will launch an Urban Gardens project, where through strategic partnerships, green zones will be created and maintained to beautify and serve as recreational spots, as part of the projects that will be carried out.", "For this purpose, \u20ac1 million will be allocated in the first year.", "38 4.2 Public Transport Mr Speaker, Government\u2019s vision for the transport sector includes a single agency that would oversee security at sea, in air and on the roads in our country.", "This is being done by acquiring technical assistance from other European countries, which have already created similar entities aimed at improving the environment and preventing fatal accidents.", "After various technical studies were carried out about the necessary upgrades in three landing ferry places, work is expected to commence next year on the quays in Bormla, Marsamxett and the Sliema Ferries.", "Eventually, there will be landing places in St Paul\u2019s Bay, St Julian\u2019s and Ta\u2019 Xbiex.", "The Government is planning to address parking challenges in our country, which is getting worse over time.", "To this end, the Government is working to introduce new schemes, through which developers can be enticed to create new parking areas, especially in urban zones, which make use of modern technology, such as mobile apps and electronic signs that indicate the parking spaces available.", "Through sensible planning and the best technologies, we should have an entire platform of transport services, in order to make people\u2019s lives easier.", "39 4.3 Free Tal-Linja Card Mr Speaker, after we extended the grant of a free Tal-Linja card, a scheme which was an enormous success, 21,000 young men and women aged between 16 years old and 20 years old benefitted from this measure.", "Not only will this scheme remain in place, but next year we are extending it so that those who have turned 20 years old, but are still full-time students, will still be eligible for free transport.", "The same applies for those aged 14 years old.", "During this year, there will be discussions with the CRPD and Agenzija Support to ensure that we include categories of people with disabilities, so that they may also be given a free Tal-Linja card.", "4.4 Free collective transport to and from school for all schools in Malta and Gozo Mr Speaker, a few weeks ago we implemented another electoral promise, that there would be free transport for all students, irrespective of which school they attend.", "Through this measure, which will cost \u20ac20 million, the parents of 26,000 students will save \u20ac700 per student per year.", "40 4.5 Grant on the purchase of bicycles, electric bicycles (pedelec bicycles) and motorcycles The grant scheme on bicycles and electronic bicycles which is the equivalent of a full VAT refund will be extended for another year.", "Even the scheme introduced in the Budget for this year, which incentivises the purchase of motorcycles, scooters and bicycles with electric engines by a maximum of \u20ac400, will be extended for next year.", "4.6 Investment in alternative modes of transport The scheme that we introduced three years ago, giving a grant to Local Councils, as well as, to those private companies which install bicycle racks to encourage more people to use bicycles, will be extended for another year.", "4.7 Incentives for the purchase of more environmentally-friendly vehicles To encourage people to buy more environmentally-friendly cars, the exemption from all registration taxes for all those who buy electric cars or hybrid cars (plug-in) will be extended to next year.", "41 4.8 Other programmes Finally, for yet another year, the vehicle scrappage scheme and the grant for those who convert their vehicle to run on gas instead of petrol will be extended.", "42 5.", "INVESTING IN THE ENVIRONMENT\n Mr Speaker, This Government is committed to prioritising our environment, our country\u2019s natural capital, which we not only want to protect, but nurture in the best possible way for future generations.", "We are committed to doing so through further infrastructural investment, by strengthening regulations and by implementing measures and environmental initiatives that truly bestow value on our natural capital.", "Waste management remains one of the biggest challenges facing the country.", "The choice that the Government has made today is a clear one \u2013 to invest in technology where non-recyclable waste can be used to generate energy.", "It is not sustainable to keep taking large tracts of land to create more rubbish dumps that we use for a relatively short time.", "We cannot keep relying on this.", "Our insularity makes the exportation of waste a heavy financial burden.", "We already realised this when we laid out the Waste Management Plan 2014-2020.", "We will not give up, we acknowledge challenges and we are wholly committed to addressing them.", "Ambjent Malta will be the country\u2019s national entity for carrying out interventions that strengthen our natural capital.", "43 5.1 Waste Treatment Mr Speaker, in the coming year, we will be continuing our work in the waste sector by preparing for the construction of a new Material Recovery Facility that will replace the one that burnt down.", "Meanwhile, we will be providing temporary infrastructure to limit the amount of recyclable waste that we have to export.", "In order to complement this facility, we shall kick off the process for a Multi-Material Recovery Facility, which will help in the recycling of various materials that would otherwise end up in the landfill.", "We will continue with the process of designing a Waste-To-Energy facility, which will be an important link in the chain of waste management facilities.", "It is our civic, moral and legal duty to separate and manage the waste we ourselves generate in an appropriate way.", "Therefore, we will be intensifying our efforts to make sure everyone separates their waste, now that we will also have a separate service for the collection of organic waste.", "It is this ambition that leads us to continue investing in this sector.", "Throughout next year, we will be planning proposals so that commercial waste is regulated in a more sustainable way.", "5.2 Introduction of the Beverage Container Refund Scheme Mr Speaker, after publishing a consultation document earlier this year for the private sector to start operating a deposit scheme on drinks 44 containers, there was an exceedingly positive response.", "Throughout next year, discussions will start in order to reach an agreement with a consortium made up of operators and importers on how such a system would be implemented.", "5.3 An appropriate environment for today Ambjent Malta\u2019s work will focus on the implementation of the Management Plans of Natura 2000 sites, which make up 11 per cent of Maltese territory.", "We will also take care of our valleys, for the biodiversity they contain and because they act as a passage for rainwater.", "We will be spurring on this sector by adding more investment.", "We will continue working on a legislative framework, regulating noises not covered by law, while planning an enforcement system in harmony with the authorities that regulate noise.", "Work will start on a National Strategy for the Environment, and the planning of a strategy for the management of alien species.", "There will be investment in a new station for air monitoring.", "In the coming year, we will not only carry on with the measure introduced this year to plant a new tree for every boy and girl born, but we will also begin planting a tree for each new vehicle imported to these islands.", "Investment in other National Parks, including Majjistral and Inwadar, will continue, and we will keep working to establish the first Geopark in our country.", "45 We will also begin investing in environmental embellishment projects in cities and villages, and even in the country\u2019s industrial zones.", "5.4 The Agricultural and Fishing sector Following the design of our agricultural policy, a number of measures will start being implemented.", "Among these, we want to continue promoting Maltese products as high-quality products and invest further in the viticulture research centre in Buskett.", "Despite the fact that farming does not contribute greatly to either economic growth or jobs, we need to restructure this sector to be more profitable, and therefore, more likely to attract young farmers who can start looking at concepts of agri-business and not just farming in the traditional way.", "In the fisheries sector, while we keep decreasing administrative burdens for fishermen, we will invest in the improvement of the Aquaculture Centre in San Lucjan and a new control hub will be developed in Marsa.", "Thanks to this control hub, the services offered to fishermen will be centralised right next to the Fish Market.", "The Government also has a plan in mind to launch a scheme for the restoration of wooden fishing boats that are more than 20 years old.", "Through this initiative, we will be helping fishermen, while preserving traditional Maltese boats and the craftsmanship associated with them.", "46 5.5 Energy and Water Mr Speaker, throughout this year, work continued to ensure the supply of sustainable energy, particularly when it comes to electricity generation and distribution.", "As promised, the Marsa power station has been completely dismantled, as has the heavy fuel oil plant in Delimara.", "As part of the Government\u2019s plan to use more clean energy, work continued on the gas pipeline which will connect Malta to Sicily.", "Furthermore, the engagement process for various experts, who will help carry out the necessary studies on the issuing of permits in Malta, as well as, Italy came to an end.", "After three new polishing plants were opened to produce newly-recycled, tertiary-treated water, we continued working on safeguarding the quality of this water.", "Throughout 2019, the Energy and Water Agency will carry on working on the National Energy and Climate Plan for the period 2020-2030, to identify a number of actions which will be taken in order to reach the European targets.", "The Government will remain committed to promoting renewable energy and the efficient use of energy sources, as well as, encouraging the conservation of water in the domestic sector, through various schemes.", "47 5.6 Energy Mr Speaker, throughout the coming year, we will continue with our policy of having stable electricity, water and fuel prices for the long-term.", "We will continue focusing on making this sector, which is fundamental to the country\u2019s economic growth, stronger and ready to face future challenges.", "This will be done through a number of measures in the generation and distribution sector, as well as, through incentives addressed at making sure energy is used in a more efficient way.", "Apart from that, we shall continue working to provide more clean energy, by promoting the use of renewable

interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation).", "Unutilised costs may be carried forward (subject to any further limitations that may be applicable under the normal provisions of the Income Tax

1.3 GAAR The Income Tax Act already contains a general anti-abuse provision (article 51) that empowers the Commissioner for Revenue to ignore tax avoidance schemes.", "The new regulations add to this rule by applying the definition of tax avoidance schemes as used in the Directive.", "The measure will accordingly apply to arrangements which are not genuine, meaning that they are not put into place for valid commercial reasons that reflect economic reality, and which have been put in place with a main purpose of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of tax law.", "1.4 Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) Rules An entity will be considered a CFC where it is subject to more than 50 per cent control by a parent company that is tax resident in Malta and its associated enterprises and the tax paid on its profits is less than half the tax that would have been paid had the income been subject to tax in Malta.", "The measure will not apply: To a CFC with accounting
