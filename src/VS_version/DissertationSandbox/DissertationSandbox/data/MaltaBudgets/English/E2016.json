budget and the fourth in this Legislature.", "I am pleased with what we have achieved so far.", "I am satisfied that the budget being presented to this House today is a confirmation that this Government's work is yielding the desired results, an affirmation that we have succeeded in changing direction and now have a strong economy.", "It is good to recall our point of departure.", "The first budget we presented had a very important aim; that of securing stability and certainty in our country.", "This was essential to steer the then slow economic growth towards a more dynamic pace in a sustainable way that benefitted everyone.", "We succeeded in bringing about a change of direction and in so doing we created an environment where one feels comfortable to expand one's business, and more importantly, to invest and create jobs.", "Back then, we presented our aims for the five years to follow.", "We were convinced we would succeed in fulfilling the ambitious goals we had set.", "Above all, we committed ourselves to exit two European Union procedures the Excessive Deficit Procedure and the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure.", "We succeeded in achieving this, as planned.", "For the year 2014, the Budget had the aim of rewarding the diligence of the people of Malta and Gozo.", "Through it, we launched a large number of measures to incentivise and reward work.", "We strived to better promote the concept of making work pay.", "We have launched tax credits and other benefits for women and even men, to enter the labour force and, above all, we introduced free childcare for couples with small children, where both parents were employed.", "3 We had the courage to implement cuts in income tax for those whose income did not exceed 60,000 (sixty thousand) Euros per annum from 35 (thirty five) per cent to 25 (twenty five) per cent.", "This left 40 million Euros in the pockets of the thousands of families that benefitted from this measure.", "At the same time, whilst we have started to carry out our plan in the energy sector to secure cheaper, sustainable and at the same time, clean energy production, we fulfilled our pledge to Maltese and Gozitan families that we would reduce utility bills by 25 per cent.", "All this helped in boosting our economy's potential for a growth that exceeded that of previous years.", "The Budget for the current year was aimed at increasing work incentives, targeting particularly those who looked upon social benefits as a system of dependence.", "The reasonable opportunities offered in the Budget to those joining the workforce to retain a portion of their social benefits for three years led to a good number of persons taking up employment for the first time.", "We were the first government to have the courage to be tough with those who abused social benefits.", "Today I am pleased to announce the positive results achieved in the first nine months of this year.", "Between December 2014 and September 2015, the number of persons depending on social assistance, unemployment benefits or single parent benefits, declined by more than 2,100.", "All these voluntarily chose one scheme or another.", "Around a thousand of those on social assistance have now moved to the system of tapering.", "4 The end result is that now there are more than two thousand persons who no longer depend on benefits.", "These are now in employment and are contributing both to society in general as well as securing their own future.", "Today we are in a position to reap the fruit of what we sowed two and a half years ago.", "The results achieved in the labour market are proof that our work is rendering results.", "Today we have among the lowest unemployment rate for in Eurospe not only men and women, but also for young people.", "This is because the number of actively employed people in our country has reached a record level.", "The latest figures show that there are now over 202 (two hundred and two) thousand persons who leave their homes for work, of whom 168 (one hundred and sixty eight) thousand are in full-time employment and more than 34 (thirty four) thousand work on a part-time basis.", "At the same time we strengthened students\u2019 stipends and apprenticeship and we introduced the Youth Guarantee.", "We announced the Maternity Fund which will lead to ending discrimination against women with regards to engaging in employment.", "We enforced the law in favour of the employment of persons with disability which thus far had existed only on paper.", "We also kept the elderly in mind by extending the annuity of 300 Euros per year for those above the age of 75 (seventy five) and still living in their homes.", "We have also compensated those who in the past paid national insurance contributions but who were not benefitting from their contributions.", "We gave the opportunity to pay up missing contributions up to five years to persons who have a number of missing contributions.", "We are seeing sectors which for years had been overlooked and neglected, such as the industries of construction and manufacturing once again regenerated, and registering an increase 5 in both added value and in the number of people employed.", "Mr Speaker, yes, this shows that Malta has changed direction and now has a strong economy.", "We are proud to be amongst the few countries to achieve what is referred to as growth friendly consolidation, which refers to the strengthening of public finances without hampering economic growth.", "This is because we have managed and succeeded in finding the right balance between the requirements of the economy and those of public finances.", "As the deficit is reduced to a record low, it has not been easy and nor will it ever be easy to strike this balance.", "However determination will lead to success.", "In June of this year, Malta exited the excessive deficit procedure.", "We are now on track for a deficit of 1.6% by the end of the year - less than half of what we inherited from the previous administration.", "This result helps both to bolster the credibility with the European Union and international institutions like the International Monetary Fund as well as to improve the credit rating of the country.", "It also shows that Malta is a thriving economy.", "We know what happened to other European countries that either allowed their debt to balloon out of control, or who went to the other extreme of trying to cut the deficit in a short time landing themselves in recession and still failing to find a solution to their debt levels.", "We want to take the middle road: the path of moderation.", "We must not think that now we have solved all our problems and that we can now rest on our laurels.", "However, we have reached a point where the feasibility of our pledges is clear.", "This thanks to the economic growth we have succeeded in generating in our country.", "6 For this to be continued, Government will seek to maintain its priorities.", "Our first priority remains that we continue to strengthen public finances.", "We shall continue to do this to make sure our children do not inherit debts as we ourselves have inherited thanks to the incorrect \u2018money no problem\u2019 policy of our predecessors.", "Contrary to what happened in the past, we believe that good fiscal governance is essential for our country.", "We must therefore ensure that we do not spend more than we can afford.", "We must continue to gradually reduce the public deficit, without stifling our economy.", "Five years are not enough to level the mountain of debt built over the past twenty five years.", "What matters to families is that the indicators will continue to be kept in the right direction.", "Our second priority is to continue to be amongst the countries with the lowest tax burden, including work-related taxes.", "We believe that people choose to work because it is in their interest to do so.", "We want to continue building a Malta where workers can enjoy the fruit of their labour and achieve one of the highest living standards in Europe.", "Our third priority is to remain open to investment, particularly foreign investment.", "No single Maltese who has the wellbeing of their country at heart would ever ridicule foreign investment or ever consider deterring investment away from our country.", "We are currently striving to attract new sectors not only for them to be economic vehicles in the forthcoming years, but also to help us be more productive as we continue to increase the standard of living of our country.", "7 The fourth priority is to continue to strengthen our social services, including health.", "We will be there for vulnerable persons and for all those in need.", "We shall continue to strengthen pensions, care of the elderly, and social services for families in need and for persons with special needs.", "Whoever is in need will find our support.", "At the same time we will continue to fight abuse in social services and fight avoidable dependence.", "The fifth priority is the environment.", "We are very much aware that in a small country like ours, the pressures on the environment are weighty and grow heavier every day.", "We are also aware that the majority of Maltese people feel that at times the need for economic development is in conflict with environmental priorities.", "As a Government we are determined to create a balance through the path of moderation.", "The sixth priority is that the generated wealth is distributed amongst all, even in the regional sense of our country.", "For many years, much of the development was focused on one area of Malta whilst other areas were not given adequate attention.", "We have already shown that we are prepared to take bold decisions which allow development to benefit everyone.", "Both Gozo and the south of Malta will remain a priority for this Government.", "The seventh priority is to continue to invest in our country's infrastructure.", "We cannot make progress if we fall behind in this sector.", "When we were elected to govern, it was clear that adequate investment was required on our roads, our ports, our schools, our hospitals, as well as in energy production.", "We are also very much aware that the current traffic problem is the result of insufficient investment in the road network but more so in inadequate public transport along the years.", "8 The eighth priority is to improve the operation of Government and rendering it more efficient.", "We want to cut down on the bureaucracy hampering the private sector in carrying its plans as well as eroding the quality of life of many families who deserve a better service.", "We want to see substantial improvements in this area.", "We are doing this by emending certain bureaucratic practices, whilst providing training and support to our civil service.", "We want to see improvements in the operation of all areas from the Law Courts to the maintenance of public order; from health services to educational services.", "Mr Speaker, this Government was elected on a clear programme: a programme to reform the institutions of our country, where all discrimination against persons is eliminated, where dependency is eradicated and work is incentivised, where investment is pro- actively encouraged in our country.", "Through this Budget we are further implementing our plan for a Strong Economy.", "9 THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL SITUATION Mr Speaker, let us now have a look at the economic and financial state of our country and how these performed when compared to last year.", "In the last year, the economic growth of the country reached new record levels.", "In fact, in the second quarter of this year, the economy grew by 5.3 per cent when compared to the same period last year whilst in nominal terms the expansion was 7.3 per cent.", "These rates of growth are almost four times higher than those registered in the Euros Zone.", "Malta is the fastest growing economy in the European Union.", "The traditional sectors, as well as those that in more recent years we have become accustomed to seeing as contributing significantly in economic growth, continued to strengthen.", "One also notes with great satisfaction that growth was also registered in sectors of the economy that for a number of years appeared to be losing their importance such as the manufacturing sector.", "During the first half of this year, economic growth was driven by sustained growth in private consumption and, more significantly, by substantial growth in investment.", "This level of economic growth was not showing only on paper.", "It translated itself in a record creation of new jobs.", "During the two and half years of this administration, full time jobs went up by almost 13,450.", "In order to put this figure in proper perspective, one can simply say that 17 new full-time jobs were created every single day.", "Of these, almost 10,900 persons were newly - employed full-time in the private sector.", "This means that eight of every ten new jobs were created in the private sector.", "This also means that the proportion of employees in the public sector today stands at 26.1% 10 of all full-time employment, half a percentage point lower than the 26.7% under the previous administration.", "When one looks at the economic growth, the number of new jobs, the rate of unemployment, the rate of inflation, export figures, as well as the macroeconomic indicators one cannot but be satisfied with the results.", "Yet another satisfactory achievement is the fact that the deficit was reduced from 3.6 per cent in 2012 to 2.6 per cent in 2013 and to 2.1 per cent in 2014.", "This improvement did not happen of its own accord.", "Demand for new projects and initiatives did not decline but, contrary to what happened in the past where the system was for government to borrow money every time it ran out of funds; this Government opted to walk away from such habits.", "We set clear objectives.", "We had promised to borrow less each year and we are keeping our pledges.", "When one decides to borrow less, one is more restricted in the use of finances.", "This is where good governance and serious planning comes in.", "In the past, Government's mantra was 'money no problem' and 'debt will be paid by our successors'.", "Contrary to this we are determined to reduce public debt so that it is no longer a burden on our children and our children's children.", "11 ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC FINANCES FORECASTS Mr Speaker, we will now look at what we are expecting for the coming year.", "Economic growth for this year is expected to reach 4.2 per cent in real terms, primarily driven by positive developments in the domestic sector of the economy, sustained by investment and a robust growth in employment as well as in income.", "The increase in employment is expected to remain robust, with an increase of 2.3 per cent in 2015.", "During 2016, economic growth is set to retain its brisk rythm although it is expected to be slightly more moderate, growing by 3.6 per cent in real terms, with the external side of the economy largely accounting for the expected growth.", "The labour market is also expected to remain strong.", "For the current year, jobs are expected to increase by 2.3 per cent.", "Throughout the coming year, the increase is expected to be 1.3 per cent.", "Consequently, the unemployment rate (based on the Eurostat\u2019s harmonised definition) is expected to decrease by 0.1 percentage points to 5.8 per cent in 2015 and further down to 5.6 per cent in 2016.", "This is well below the expected Eurospean Union average rate and reflects efforts in ongoing active labour market policies.", "Next year, Government\u2019s revenue is expected to be slightly over 3.6 billion Euros whilst total expenditure is forecast to be around 3.8 billion Euros.", "This should result in a deficit of 196 million Euros in the Consolidated Fund.", "In 2016 the deficit is expected to go down to 102 million Euros or a deficit of 1.1 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product.", "The details are set out in Table 1, Table 2 and in the statements A, B and C annexed to this speech.", "12 During the coming year Government is aiming to reduce public debt from 68.3 per cent of Gross Domestic Product in 2014 to 65.2 per cent in 2016.", "More details regarding public debt extended over the coming years are found in Table 3.", "Cost of Living Allowance According to the mechanism agreed with the social partners, the cost of living allowance for next year would be of 1.75 Euros per week.", "This will be given to all employees, as well as in full to pensioners and to those persons receiving social benefits.", "Students will be receiving the cost of living allowance on a pro-rata basis so that for yet another year we will again increase students\u2019 stipends.", "Consolidated Fund\n Tax

maintained that the Budget is not simply and exercise in balancing Government's books but an economic exercise where tax adjustments, be they up or down, are intended to incentivize economic growth, a more efficient allocation of resources and a fair and just distribution of wealth.", "Adjustment of Income Tax Rate In the past three years we announced a reduction in the rates of income tax from 35 per cent to that of 25 per cent on income not exceeding 60,000 Euros per annum.", "Forty thousand persons benefitted from this measure.", "This helped to reward diligence so that our economy could continue to grow.", "Today, because Malta has a strong economy, a direct result of our change in direction, we are in a position to announce that once again we shall be reducing income tax rates.", "First of all, whoever earns an income which does not exceed the minimum wage, be it from employment or a pension will once again be exempt from income tax.", "Secondly, whoever did not benefit from the reductions of income tax effected during this legislature will start doing so now.", "A person with a single declaration earning up to 9,100 Euros, a couple with a joint declaration earning up to 12,700 Euros and a person with a single parent declaration earning up to 10,500 Euros, will be exempt from income tax.", "A person with a single declaration earning up to 19,500 Euros will be saving up to 90 Euros in tax annually.", "17 A person with a single parent declaration earning up to 21,200 Euros will be saving up to 105 Euros per year in tax.", "A couple making a joint declaration who earn up to 28,700 Euros will be saving up to 120 Euros in tax.", "In the case of a married couple where both partners work and opt for single computation will be saving up to 180 Euros between them.", "In the case of a couple earning up to 21,000 Euros each, the savings in tax would be up to 210 Euros.", "This measure will affect more than 117,000 beneficiaries and will cover 160,000 persons.", "The pledge that whoever is on the minimum wage will not be liable to tax on income, including the bonus, will remain in force.", "The same applies to pensioners in the same income category.", "This is the fruit of a robust economy that is generating wealth; wealth that is being distributed fairly and reaching more families.", "The new tax computations to be used may be found in Annex 'A' attached to this speech.", "18 Less Tax on Sport In order to encourage more sporting activity and as part of our fight against obesity we shall be reducing VAT on sporting activities, including gym memberships, fitness centres, football nurseries and other activities from 18 per cent to 7 per cent.", "We will also be extending the reduced rate of income tax of 7.5 per cent, which currently applies to football and waterpolo players, to coaches and players in all kinds of sport.", "15% Tax Rate on Police Extra Duty Effective 1st January 2016, payments made to members of the Police Force for extra duty which is carried out for the benefit of organisations, individuals and companies, will be taxed separately at the rate of 15 per cent.", "This will fulfil another electoral pledge.", "In-Work Benefit This year we introduced the in-work scheme.", "The beneficiaries are single parents or couples who are both gainfully employed.", "The aim was to encourage more people to enter the labour force.", "This scheme will be retained even in the coming year.", "For single parents, the benefit is of a maximum of 1,200 Euros for every child and applies to all those with an income of between 6,600 and 15,000 Euros per annum.", "For couples, where both persons are working and earning between 10,000 and 20,000 Euros, the benefit is of a maximum of 1,000 Euros for each child.", "In this Budget, Government now wants to acknowledge those families made up of couples where only one person is employed in a low paid job and where there are dependent children under the age of 23.", "Thus, the In-Work benefit will be extended to those families who are dependent on a single earner, declaring an income in the range between 6,600 and 12,700 Euros.", "The maximum benefit will be of 150 Euros for every child.", "19 Around 3,700 families and almost 5,000 boys and girls, many of whom are at risk of poverty, will be benefitting from this measure.", "The incentive for the second parent to enter the labour force will be maintained.", "In fact, where both parents are gainfully employed, the benefit goes up to a maximum of 1,000 Euros for every child.", "Pensions Various measures benefitting pensioners were put in place over the past two years.", "We removed the link between the widows' pension and the level of income and the children's' ages so that widows could benefit from a full widow\u2019s pension.", "We also saw to exempt from tax pensioners whose pension does not exceed the minimum wage.", "We introduced a regulatory framework for private pensions, better known as Third Pillar, strengthened with fiscal incentives.", "We are informed that in the coming weeks, products in relation to this scheme by various private financial operators will be launched.", "As of next year we will be setting up a working group to consider what fiscal benefits may be accorded to employers who undertake private pension schemes for their employees on a voluntary basis.", "Earlier on in this legislature a Pensions Strategy Group was set up to address the adequacy and sustainability of the pensions system.", "The Group published its report earlier this year, proposing 27 recommendations for public consultation.", "The response of civil society was generally positive.", "Although the recommendations are diverse, we shall be putting into effect those recommendations considered a priority as of this budget.", "20 It should be said at the outset that Government does not intend to raise the age of retirement and neither is it considering any increase in national insurance contributions or the introduction any other new contribution.", "Regarding the National Minimum Pension, the Group recommended that by 2027 this pension should be equivalent to 60% of the average wage in the country.", "For this purpose we shall be taking the first steps in the process leading to the target as of this year.", "This Government wants every pensioner who is currently on a low pension to benefit irrespective of his or her age.", "Therefore, with great pleasure I announce that as of 1st January coming, 12,000 elderly persons will benefit from an increment in their pension.", "Next year the minimum amount payable for a contributory pension, including the bonus, for those with sufficient contributions will be 7,280 Euros per annum or 140 Euros per week.", "Pensioners with insufficient contributions will receive payments pro rata.", "The increase in pensions for those who will be benefitting from this measure will be of 8.92 Euros weekly for those aged 75 and over and of 8 Euros weekly for those below 75 years.", "Married couples who currently receive the minimum pension for married persons and who will not benefit from the above measure will also be given increased payments beyond the COLA totalling 4.15 Euros per week.", "More than 12,000 persons will benefit from this provision.", "Mr Speaker, this will effectively mean that thousands of persons will exit or start moving away from the risk of poverty.", "This is possible because Malta has a strong economy.", "As part of the pension reform recommended by the Group, National Insurance contributions will be credited to parents who had to leave work to 21 care for their offspring or whoever could not work for reasons of study and/or specialisation.", "As an example, a woman who left work for two years to care for a newborn or to complete her studies will have two years\u2019 worth of contributions credited to her.", "More examples will be given later on.", "Government believes there should be a fair and just balance between the number of years one spends paying contributions and the number of years one is expected to be on a pension, which principle should help in guaranteeing the sustainability of the pensions system.", "For this reason we shall be extending the number of years of valid contributions from 40 to 41 years for persons born after 1968.", "At the same time we want to incentivise more people who on a voluntary basis and in agreement with their employer, choose to remain in employment.", "This measure will be open to the private sector.", "For those who stay in employment and do not apply for a pension when they are entitled to it, the rate of their pension will be increased by a percentage for every additional year they stay in employment, which higher rate of pension they will receive for the rest of their lives.", "Another advantageous measure which benefits pensioners or their surviving spouses is that the pension will be payable from the day after which their employment comes to an end or from the date of the death of their husband or wife.", "In any one year this measure benefits around 2,800 persons.", "The elderly aged 75 and over will continue receiving the grant of 300 Euros per year.", "22 Anomalies Government has already addressed a number of these anomalies.", "However there is yet more to be done.", "These anomalies are being considered with the aim of reaching an appropriate and sustainable solution.", "Government therefore reiterates its commitment that over a reasonable number of years, the necessary measures will be put in place to address the anomalies affecting various categories of workers, including former members of the ex-Labour Corps, former employees of the Electricity Board and others.", "Intensive talks have already started with Port Workers with the aim of reaching a mutually equitable agreement.", "We shall continue deducting an additional 200 Euros every year from the service pensions for the purposes of the social security pension.", "Pilot Fund for Live-in Carers It is being proposed to launch a pilot fund of one million Euros intended to subsidise the wages payable to qualified carers employed on a full-time or part-time basis when these are so employed to care for elderly persons.", "The subsidy would be capped at fifty per cent of the minimum wage and pro-rata for part-time engagements.", "As a pilot project, the programme is initially being offered to elderly persons who to date are on the waiting list to enter into homes for the elderly.", "Whoever opts for the subsidy will no longer be on the waiting list.", "Carers Pension Apart from this, the two schemes currently in effect, that is the Carers Pension and the Social Assistance for Carers, will be revised and amalgamated within one framework.", "Eligibility for the new scheme will also be revised and widened allowing more 23 people who care for the elderly in their own homes to benefit from the revised scheme, thus helping more elderly persons to continue living in their own homes.", "Community Chest Fund Companies making donations of not less than 2,000 Euros to the Community Chest Fund during the year 2015 will be given a rebate on their income tax return equivalent to 100 per cent of their donation.", "We would thus be incentivising and acknowledging the philanthropic assistance accorded by these companies.", "Fiscal Incentives for the Property Market First-Time Buyers One of the most favourable measures for young couples was the exemption from stamp duty for first time buyers.", "This scheme came to an end at the end of June of this year.", "We are once again extending this concession up to the end of next year with a new scheme through which young couples will be saving a maximum of 5,000 Euros on their first residential property.", "This will be backdated to the date of promises of sale which entered into force since 1st July 2015, corresponding to the closing date of the last scheme.", "Those first time buyers who entered promises of sale and contracts of sale after the 1st July will be refunded the stamp duty they have paid.", "24 Rent on Property Throughout this year, property owners were given the option of paying a withholding tax of 15 per cent on leases of residential properties.", "Now we are extending this concession to also cover commercial properties and companies.", "Companies which form part of the same group of companies and who lease properties to each other will be excluded.", "Vacant Property One of the major causes of vacant properties is litigation between heirs.", "The current position is that if 51 per cent of heirs agree on a sale price of immovable property and the other heirs disagree, the property can only be sold after ten or five years from the opening of succession, depending on the date of such succession.", "Therefore, in order to minimise this phenomenon of vacant properties, this period of ten or five years will be reduced to three years with respect to all immovable property already inherited or yet to be inherited.", "For this purpose Government will be enacting legislation by the end of the current year so that this new period of three years will come into effect as of next year once the necessary amendments to the law are put into effect during the first quarter of the year.", "This legislation will also provide that all properties sold through this procedure are to be enrolled in the register of properties that fall within the land registration area.", "To further cut down on vacant property and ease the pressure for new buildings, stamp duty on properties within the Urban Conservation Area will be reduced by half - from 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent.", "This concession will apply to contracts finalised between 1st January 2016 and 31st December 2016.", "25 In the last Budget Speech we announced the removal of MEPA fees on permits relating to the refurbishment of properties in the UCAs in order to incentivise the regeneration of our villages.", "For the coming year we shall be reducing the property sales tax (Final Withholding Tax) from 8 per cent to 5 per cent for owners selling refurbished property within urban conservation areas.", "This refurbishment will be carried out according to the dispositions of current legislation.", "Abandoned Commercial Property Government wishes to improve the environment in which we live.", "Abandoned property is a major eyesore in numerous localities.", "We will initially focus on commercial properties - such as showrooms which are left derelict and open to easy access and which, in certain cases, pose a clear danger to health and safety, apart from being eyesores.", "For this purpose Government will launch a process of public consultation with the aim of drawing up a plan to establish legal obligations making it mandatory for commercial property to be properly maintained and to set out the sanctions applicable in default.", "Refund of VAT paid on Car Registration Tax As promised, we continued to make ex-gratia payments related to registration tax paid in excess by persons registering vehicles between 1st May 2004 and 31st December 2008.", "This year this ex-\n gratia refund will be made to all those who registered their vehicle during 2005.", "This means that by the end of next year we would have refunded a total of 9.7 million Euros in tax levied in excess.", "Fuel Prices Fuel prices will once again be reduced as of next January.", "This is possible because Enemed has finalised an agreement through which the price of petrol can be reduced by 3 Euros cents whilst 26 the price of diesel will be reduced by 4 Euros cents per litre.", "This price includes an increase in excise duty of 3 Euros cents on both types of fuel.", "The rate of excise duty applicable to lubricating oil will also increase by 2 Euros cents whilst the price of kerosene will increase by 3 Euros cents per litre.", "Excise duty on fuel oil will go up by 3 Euros cents per tonne.", "We will continue to strive for stability in the price of gas.", "The current price will be retained up to the end of next April.", "This is the lowest price in the past 4 years.", "It also means that the price of gas would have been stable for 9 whole months including the cold winter months.", "This Government is looking for price stability as against fluctuations in pricing from month to month, with consumers having to carry the burden whenever the price went up.", "It should be recalled that this Government has reduced the cost of water and electricity for businesses and for households when previous administrations increased the price of both utilities as well as increased the price of petrol and diesel by 20 per cent when the international price of oil was at its lowest.", "Environmental Contribution Our country is well on its way to hosting around 2 million tourists a year and this at greater profit for the private sector.", "Whilst the growth of tourism is generating wealth in the economy, we must ensure that the country has the desired necessary quality infrastructure to sustain this development and the success we are witnessing whilst at the same time taking concrete measures for the licensing of accommodation as yet unlicensed.", "Government has decided that an environmental contribution be levied as of 1st April 2016, payable by all tourists above the age of 18 who visit our country.", "This will be a low rate of 50 Euros cents 27 for each night spent in Malta but capped at a maximum for 5 Euros for each continuous stay.", "For this purpose discussions will be held with all stake holders regarding the best implementation of this measure.", "The revenue from this measure, which is estimated to be around 6 million Euros, will be administered by the Foundation for the Development of Tourist Zones for the purpose of upgrading, improving and maintaining the major public zones in the country.", "The structure of this Foundation will be reformed and it will take the shape of a Public Private Partnership with the participation of the MHRA.", "Government intends to make an additional contribution to this Fund.", "With this measure we will be investing in an improved touristic product and in the sustainability of our tourism sector so that more economic benefits from tourism may be shared by all in the future.", "Reform of the Eco-Contribution As pledged in the Budget for last year, the eco-contribution due on electrical and electronic goods was abolished as of 1st September 2015.", "This was the first step in the reform Government wants to implement in this sector to ensure a level playing field in the market.", "Meanwhile, some of the products to be exempt from the eco-\n contribution are a source of pollution or are not easy to clean up.", "In the case of such products the eco-contribution will be replaced by an excise duty.", "This will strengthen the message in favour of a clean environment whilst at the same time eliminating abuse.", "The tables contained in the Annexes to this Speech clearly set out the exemptions from the eco-contribution as well as the level of excise duty which will replace the eco-contribution on such products.", "28 These include chewing gum, plastic carrier bags and containers for soft drinks and non-alcoholic beverages.", "Through these adjustments we are continuing to discourage consumption practices that are detrimental to the environment.", "During the coming year talks will be held between Government and the stake-holders concerned to finalise the total removal of this tax.", "This process should be completed by the 1st of September 2016.", "Excise Duty on Tobacco and Cement In the interest of health and environmental protection, there will be a further increase of 5 Euros per tonne in the excise duty on cement, as well as an increase in the excise duty on cigarettes and tobacco as set out in the Annex to this Speech.", "The market price of a packet of cigarettes will go up by an average of 30 cents per packet.", "29 3: INCENTIVISING WORK : THE NEXT STEP A better functioning labour market A robust economy needs a strengthening of its major institutions, amongst which is the labour market.", "This is what will come about in the Employment and Training Corporation which shall henceforth be known as JobsPlus.", "A unit of job market analysts will also be set up to carry out research and give advice in this sector.", "In agreement with the social partners represented on the MCESD, we will be putting together employment contract templates.", "These will be placed online and will be accessible for download by everyone.", "Thus we will be ensuring that all workers would have an employment contract that reflects the conditions stipulated by law.", "In the coming months, a Charter setting out the basic work conditions will be distributed to all households in Malta and Gozo so that all concerned, including workers in vulnerable sectors, would be made aware of the basic conditions they are entitled to in their respective work place.", "Work on the Job Matching System, which was undertaken together with VDAB of Belgium, has just been finalised.", "The necessary training for employers and job seekers is expected to start in the coming weeks.", "We will once again give a boost to co-\n operatives where workers unions could take a pro-active role in their creation.", "Apart from the decline in youth unemployment, we are also working to ensure as far as is possible that most persons find the employment they wish to be in.", "Although it is evident that in Malta, University and MCAST students do not face much difficulty in finding work, through the Job Practice initiative we 30 aim to give MCAST students an opportunity to widen their skills portfolio.", "Access to Training and Jobs The Active Labour Market Policies implemented by this government have had a positive impact on the job market, as is clearly evidenced by the results.", "During the coming months we shall be launching various other initiatives to attract more people into the labour force.", "The ETC has activated the Work Programme, whereby three private operators will be assisting in finding work placements for those who have been registering for work for a long period of time.", "As of this November Government will be launching the Access to Employment initiative (A2E).", "This scheme will be giving assistance to enterprises to promote job opportunities for the most disadvantaged who are without work or are seeking employment.", "Following the success of the Training Aid Framework we shall now be launching the Investing in Skills initiative.", "As was the case in the past year, all payments due to employers will be made within a few months not years.", "As of next year we will be launching 'Training Pays' - which scheme will encourage more people to undertake the necessary training.", "Part of the training will be subsidised.", "The Work Exposure and Traineeships schemes were instrumental in reducing unemployment.", "Therefore, for the next seven years we shall be offering 500 work exposure and traineeship placements every year.", "This will help to further reduce unemployment to the lowest levels ever recorded in our country.", "31 Community Work Scheme We have endeavoured to engage persons in the Community Work Scheme in full-time work within a private agency.", "After a call for tenders, the evaluating committee is in the process of finalising the adjudication.", "In the coming months we will be fulfilling our pledge to scores of persons currently in precarious employment.", "The Fight Against Precarious Work From its very first days, this Government embarked on an unprecedented fight against precarious work.", "Thousands of workers were being exploited through loopholes in labour legislation and, even worse, Government itself was sponsoring precarious work when acquiring services by tender.", "The worst forms of precarious work were in the cleaning, security and caring services.", "Today the page has turned but there are still a few employers who are abusing the system.", "The first steps taken by this Government were the introduction of new rules, including the information that must be given to workers regarding engagement and sub-contracting.", "As of 2015, hundreds of workers benefitted from another measure which accorded the basic wage payable to state workers to workers employed by contractors for identical work, upon renewal of the contract.", "This year, another 400 workers will be benefitting from this measure as their company's new contract comes into force.", "This year also saw the setting up of the Commercial Sanctions Tribunal which applies blacklisting, meaning that companies found guilty of implementing precarious work practices would be barred from tendering for government contracts.", "Moreover, all work practices adopted are being continually monitored and an open dialogue exists with the unions so as to better scrutinise whatever goes on not only in the public sector but 32 also in those areas of the private sector where precarious employment could also be a problem.", "The Youth Guarantee In the first two years since the implementation of the Youth Guarantee, youth unemployment went down from 14.0 per cent to 8.7 per cent.", "This is among the best performances registered in member countries of the Eurospean Union.", "The success achieved fills us with courage and therefore this guarantee will continue to be offered in the coming years.", "Persons with Disability in the Labour Force This year we set in motion one of the biggest social reforms of all time in the field of labour and persons with disabilities, namely the enforcement of the legislation that requires all medium and large enterprises to employ a percentage of persons with disability.", "We carried out consultations, and whilst together with employers a number of difficulties were identified, we remain determined that the system will succeed.", "The results are already evident.", "Previously, the Employment and Training Corporation was only able to find work placements for less than a 100 special needs persons per year.", "Now we are able for find employment for 24 persons with disability every month.", "This is the result of a strong economy, and Government is determined to operate with a social conscience.", "This year, the contribution due by companies employing more than 20 workers and who do not observe the law is of \u20ac800 for each person with disability not employed.", "As already announced this will now be raised to \u20ac1,600 as of next year.", "33 This money will be used through the Lino Spiteri Foundation to offer training to and find jobs for persons with disability, as well as employing more job coaches to assist employers and persons with disability at the workplace.", "To further encourage employers to engage persons with disability we shall be renewing the incentive whereby Government pays the national insurance contribution for these employees whilst employers are refunded 25% of the wage paid, together with a subsidy of \u20ac125 a week for three years.", "Illegal Immigrants and the Job Market This Government has the courage to confront the problem of illegal work and the exploitation of illegal immigrants.", "Apart from the fact that these persons are exploited, such illegality undermines the conditions of Maltese and Gozitan workers.", "A process of consultation will be launched regarding the setting up of an Immigration Work Office in the shape of a PPP.", "Through this system whoever wishes to employ immigrants for a limited number of hours can do so legally as long as the work conditions are legal.", "The rate of pay is yet to be determined and we shall ensure that Maltese and Gozitan workers are not placed at a disadvantage.", "We will no longer tolerate loitering and soliciting as happens every day at

open to the talent and skills that are needed in Malta.", "Other countries are doing their utmost to be business friendly.", "Above all, we must enhance our country's competitiveness.", "Energy Over the past two years we laid the foundations for the necessary reforms required in the energy sector, primarily through the improvements in Enemalta, which from a bankrupt corporation not worth more

Enemalta's financial situation continues to improve.", "This is being reflected in the credit rating and outlook for this company, which in turn, impacts positively the credit rating of the country in general.", "At the same time, we are paying back the high levels of debt left to accumulate by the previous administration without ever paying back a single cent of it.", "Enemalta is also working with its strategic partner Shanghai Electric Power to commence their joint operations, which will lead the company to commence investing in new international projects in the field of renewable energy and the provision of an energy service centre.", "Next year, the country will have a new gas power station.", "It will be a power station of the highest level in terms of efficiency and emission reduction.", "This is a project which is being consistently praised by credit rating agencies and even by the European Commission as being crucial in this field after many years during which nothing was ever done to address the country-specific recommendation served on Malta every year by the European Commission for this purpose.", "All of this is leading Malta to have a strong economy.", "Enemalta is focusing much of its operations on strengthening electricity distribution through the building or extension of various distribution centres.", "This investment is essential for a reliable distribution of electricity from Enemalta to households and businesses, to ensure fewer and shorter power cuts.", "This aspect of operations grows in importance in view of the economic 40 growth of the Maltese economy characterised by large scale investments.", "Incentives for Alternative Energy Various incentives were launched during 2015 in favour of a more sizeable investment in renewable

situation and also spurred on a considerable number of projects co-financed by the European Union, intended to continue improving its operation and water distribution.", "This investment is expected

Conservation which will offer a multi-media experience about the importance of water and the need of a better use of this essential resource.", "Depreciation on the Capital Expenditure We shall be introducing further measures that offer incentives to investors in various sectors.", "We plan to implement a measure through which entrepreneurs investing in premises intended for use as office space

Small Enterprises Government is committed to continue the fight against excessive bureaucracy.", "We want to minimise the burden faced by entrepreneurs seeking to start up or extend a business in Malta.", "There are still numerous cumbersome administrative procedures that can be amended so that the entrepreneur would not have to deal with excessive bureaucracy, and at the same time the controls on the entrepreneur\u2019s due diligence will not be reduced.", "Our goal by the end of this legislature is to arrive at a point where the bureaucratic process entailed in starting operation of an enterprise in Malta does not take longer than an average of one week, compared to the average of three weeks that the process takes today.", "This would be in accordance with the methodology outlined in the World Bank annual report \u2018Ease of Doing Business\u2019.", "Assistance Programmes In order to be more effective in the assistance it offers to enterprises operating from Malta, Malta Enterprise has further developed new assistance schemes, including a number of new programmes which will be launched this year, and next year.", "These are: Assistance to Artisans The Malta Crafts Council and Malta Enterprise will be launching a pilot project intended to train new artisans to be able to develop sectors of traditional crafts that are in danger of disappearing.", "This

financial assistance of up to \u20ac200,000, in line with private equity.", "In the case of an innovative enterprise developing new products, processes or new services of a level higher than what is

to generate capital through crowd funding.", "Assistance for a more efficient use of energy An efficient use of energy is an important element affecting industrial competitiveness.", "With this in

difficult for small manufacturing enterprises to find adequate space at a sustainable price, especially in a period of growth when the enterprise is in the 44 process of expanding its capital investment.", "To address this, Malta Enterprise will be launching an incentive for small enterprises leasing additional space from the private sector for the purposes of manufacturing, through which they will be compensated for relocation.", "The aid will be given for a period not exceeding two years and up to a maximum of \u20ac10,000 per annum.", "Assistance for knowledge transfer Malta Enterprise will be launching an assistance scheme to subsidise knowledge transfer within enterprises.", "This is intended to help with the transfer of skills from present to new employees and for

financial grant where the project is of significant importance in the development of the company.", "Assistance for increased female participation in enterprises To enhance entrepreneurship among

discussion with sport associations regarding how these clubs and associations could attract investment in their facilities so that sport in Malta could be managed more sustainably and on a more solid base.", "We believe this is crucial in reaching our goal of having a better organized and more professional sport sector.", "This should also lead to a change in mentality in the running of sport facilities in Malta, and should improve the quality of training at various levels, from children to professional athletes.", "Together with the Youth Agency we will ensure that the Youth Village is equipped with new sports buildings and facilities which can be used by the ALP and the Youth.inc students, as well as other youths and sports associations.", "71 Building of schools and educational facilities Following this year\u2019s opening of the new National School for Sport, we have plans for a number of new buildings and infrastructural maintenance works which include the extension of the Wardija centre, the Marsascala football pitch, the upper secondary schools in \u0126al-Kirkop and \u0126ad-Dingli and the conversion of what was formerly the Treasury Building for use by the Examinations Department.", "Next year will also see the commencement of the first phase of the new school in St Paul's Bay and works on the track at the National School for Sport in Pembroke.", "Presidency of the European Union Preparations in the build-up for Malta's Presidency of the European Union are now maturing.", "During 2016 this build-up should reach its climax so that in the first half of 2017 our country will fulfil this task successfully.", "72 10: INVESTING IN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT A better health service This year we continued to treat the health service as a priority as we have always done.", "Last year we said that we wanted to tackle better access and quality in the health service and throughout this year we concentrated precisely on this goal.", "During this year we worked incessantly to shorten waiting times for various kinds of surgeries and interventions.", "As an example, waiting times for MRIs were reduced from one and a half years as they were in 2013 to three months.", "In the case of cataract operations, the waiting time was reduced from three years in 2013 to six months.", "Substantial reductions were also achieved in the waiting lists for sleep studies, EMG, Echocardiograms, bone density scans and angiograms.", "Through agreements with private clinics we are also reducing waiting times for ENT operations as well as vein interventions and other day case surgeries.", "This year we will consolidate these initiatives and we shall be pushing for a major reduction in waiting times for hip and knee replacements.", "This will ensure better quality of life for a large number of people and will be implemented through PPP agreements.", "Last year we said we would address the great problem posed by a small general hospital that does not reflect today's needs.", "To address this problem, with immediate effect, we worked to tackle the shortage of beds at Mater Dei.", "By the end of this year, a new block will be accommodating 68 new beds.", "This is an important achievement but it is still not enough.", "Government is therefore committed to launch a new project to build more floors so that this 73 new block would offer 300 beds.", "Plans for this are at advanced stage.", "We have achieved all of this despite the huge problem of weak concrete at Mater Dei left by the previous government.", "In this respect, we shall continue striving for our country's rights, despite the waiver clause irresponsibly agreed to by the previous administration exonerating Skanska of all responsibility.", "We are also introducing new systems in bed management at Mater Dei in order to make the most efficient use of the space this hospital offers.", "Currently, considerable progress is being registered in the Public Private Partnership for the development of the Gozo General Hospital together with Bart's Medical School, a medical school of the highest standard and repute.", "This development will offer a high level of service to Gozitans without the need of travelling to Malta.", "The Gozo hospital will become a fully fledged general hospital as well as a facility for medical tourism.", "Not only will jobs not be lost but on the contrary there will be new work opportunities in Gozo for Gozitan health workers.", "At the same time Karen Grech Hospital in Malta will be redeveloped into a 320 bed hospital for the elderly.", "A new rehabilitation hospital will also be developed, offering facilities that currently do not exist.", "Eighty rehabilitation beds will be allocated to the Maltese Government.", "We shall also be developing a new dermatology centre with 12 inpatient beds.", "In addition, St Luke's Hospital will also offer house facilities for medical tourism.", "This project will be creating 1,000 new jobs.", "In the coming months there will be further consultations with all the stakeholders regarding this important transition.", "74 We also tackled the problem of out of stock medicines.", "In 2013 the number of medicines that were out of stock in the Pharmacy Of Your Choice scheme were 130.", "This was drastically reduced and we succeeded in maintaining the levels announced last year, that is, an average that does not exceed five medications out of stock at any one time.", "These results have to be seen against a background of larger numbers of persons qualifying for POYC scheme.", "In 2014 such eligible persons numbered 131,000 and in the first nine months of the current year this number rose to 138,000.", "We are working together with the operators of the POYC scheme and their representatives to introduce a service level agreement regarding the services offered and to launch a pilot project for the home delivery of medicines during the coming year, as pledged in our electoral manifesto.", "In 2013 we also addressed the problem of out of stock medicines even at our hospitals.", "In Mater Dei alone we found 200 types of medication that were not in stock.", "For the benefit of our patients, this amount was drastically reduced to an average of five, for the benefit of our patients.", "This at a time when others maintained that even a grocery shop would have items that were out of stock.", "We are also working to expand a pilot project of framework procurement agreements for the supply of medicines.", "This will mean that in due course, medicines would be stocked and stored by the pharmaceutical suppliers themselves and no longer by government, resulting in greater efficiency in supply and in Government cash flow.", "There will be additional consultation about this process of procurement.", "This Government is committed to consolidating primary health care because it acknowledges that apart from making health services more accessible to the patient, the strengthening of this sector results in a more efficient and sustainable health service.", "Discussions are in progress with private family doctors with a view to enhancing their role in the health service and with local 75 councils for the latter to take over the administration of local health clinics.", "We have greatly improved the services and facilities in all health centres, including the installation of x-ray machines, INR testing (warfarin) and new ECG equipment.", "Soon we will be issuing a call for expressions of interest in the running of a new Health Centre in \u0126al-Kirkop based on the model of a Public-Private Partnership together with Projects Malta.", "We shall be consolidating the reforms currently being made in the Accident & Emergency Department, where we shall continue with efforts to reduce waiting times.", "To this end, during the past year we increased the number of cubicles in A&E to 11, we introduced new IT systems and increased the number of doctors and nurses such that today waiting times in the A&E have gone down from 13 hours to less than 4 in 90% of cases.", "We shall also be offering a dedicated Paediatric Emergency service which will offer a more congenial environment for children.", "We are also engaged in significant efforts to improve our Mental Health Services and we are in the process of appointing a dedicated Board of Directors.", "Extensive works were also carried out at Mount Carmel Hospital with a major focus on juvenile wards.", "In the coming months we shall be implementing plans for further substantial improvements in this hospital.", "Having this year completed the logistic groundwork, as from next month we shall be sending out invitations for cervical screening in an effort to minimise the risk of cervical cancer for Maltese and Gozitan women.", "We shall also continue the public debate regarding the amendment of IVF legislation, a topic which we notice is attracting a wide interest.", "In the meantime this year we started offering IVF 76 treatments at Mater Dei and by the end of 2015 we would have given this service to 200 couples.", "By the end of this year we would have added new medications to the government list of free medicines, including new medications for diabetes, a disease that kills 10% of our population.", "In the coming weeks we shall be increasing the value of vouchers for patients with celiac disease.", "Every month the pharmaceutical industry releases new medicines on the market for the benefit of patients.", "Many of these new medications are very expensive.", "We shall be working on the development of a system that will enable us to provide our patients with cancer and orphan disease drugs whilst at the same time keeping our health services sustainable.", "We shall endeavour to do this in collaboration with our partners in the industry both in Malta and in Europe.", "More resources for the environment Government believes that the environment is one of the major mainstays of the people's quality of life and therefore, in 2016 we shall continue with specific initiatives in this field, including the conservation of a number of sites of natural importance through special agreements with various environmental NGOs.", "In order to plan ahead, more information that can be analysed in a short period of time is required.", "In the coming year we will be launching a new Spatial and Mapping Service project of the whole Maltese territory.", "The first phase of this project will be partly financed through EU funds.", "During 2016 Government will be bolstering its structures and resources to fulfil its national, European and international obligations in the fields of sustainable development, the environment and climate change as well as agriculture, fisheries and animal rights.", "77 Meanwhile, in an effort to improve the environment, we shall be embarking on a programme of seawater monitoring with the aim of better protecting the environment of the sea.", "This monitoring programme will enhance Malta's maritime policy and ensure sustainable development in tourism.", "As pledged in our electoral programme, the strategic demerger within MEPA will soon take effect so to establish the Environment and Resources Authority.", "Government is committed to see that this new Authority would have all the necessary human and financial resources to truly be in a position to safeguard the Maltese environment in the best possible way.", "Food Waste Bill Consultation Government will be examining best practices and will launch a process of consultation to establish whether it is necessary to introduce legislation, and if in the affirmative, what type of legislation is required to control the amount of food that is thrown away, particularly by large establishments like supermarkets.", "Waste Management Following the groundwork accomplished this year, we are in the process of issuing a call for proposals regarding the collection of plastic bottles and metal cans used as drink containers with the aim of identifying the best method for such a collection to be organised and this by the first half of next year.", "WasteServ In the coming year WasteServ will continue with its intensive commitment to enhance the efficiency of the plants it operates.", "Another challenge for the coming year is the scheme for the collection of batteries by private entities.", "WasteServ will also continue working on the fulfilment of the national waste management plan.", "Amongst other things, the reform process in 78 Civic Amenity sites will be identifying the best way to involve the private sector in the administration of these sites.", "The Pace Grasso Project Government is in the process of planning and laying the groundwork for the regeneration of the site currently occupied by the Pace Grasso ground in Paola.", "Following MEPA's completion of the master plan for this region, an application was filed for the building of a regional health centre with a planned expenditure of around \u20ac30 million, co-financed through European funds.", "The development would also include a family resource centre as well as residential facilities in the community for persons with disability (priority centre).", "There will also be commercial and car parking facilities.", "Half of the site will be converted into an open and recreational spaces and will serve as a \u201clung\u201d for the south region.", "An environmental \"lung\" for the Grand Harbour area 2016 will see the commencement of a project through which the Floriana botanical garden and other gardens in the area will be opened, renovated and transformed into a recreational environmental centre.", "This will be a project that will provide an environmental \u201clung\u201d for the Grand Harbour area.", "Meantime, as promised by Government earlier this year, works will also commence so that a new park for the south of Malta, located in Marsascala, will be developed.", "Green Economy and Circular Economy Action Plan A green economy is an economy that acknowledges that natural and ecological assets and related services have an economic value.", "This concept ties in with that of the circular economy.", "The cost related to the green economy could be compensated through an increase in competiveness and job creation, protection of resources 79 and the enhancement of wellbeing.", "Thus, ecological growth should be viewed as a new motor in the creation of value added in Malta.", "In this context, Government has drawn up a Green Economy Strategy and Action Plan.", "This contains a list of actions promoting investment and economic growth aimed at education, job creation and sustainability of resources in various other sectors of the economy including waste management, water, energy, transport, tourism, agriculture, construction and industry.", "Waste sector has a direct impact on the socioeconomic context of the Maltese Islands.", "There is in fact a need for a change to a circular economy which re-purposes and recycles the waste created by the economy itself, particularly industrial waste.", "This process would generate raw materials and save natural resources.", "In this regard, Malta is committed to increase its efforts in waste management according to a waste hierarchy.", "This includes better waste separation at source and support to businesses, local authorities and related third party organisations in the integration of the supply chain with the aim of a better integration within a circular process.", "Green manufacturing is a very important element of a circular economy which should lead to lower costs of raw material and profits from productivity whilst reducing the environmental impact of industry.", "Investing in agriculture and fisheries Under the new plan for rural development there will be new incentives for the production and promotion of quality agricultural products.", "A framework of certification and control, drawn up this year, will be operated.", "With a view to enhancing environmental sustainability, we are studying a new management system for farm waste.", "This reform has been left pending for several years.", "During this year, another one of the Government\u2019s 80 electoral promises was consolidated with the full functionality of the Office of the Commissioner for Animal Welfare.", "There are also plans for the re-establishment of the extension services in agriculture to provide farmers and breeders with technical advice on horticulture and animal rearing.", "Works will also continue in the coming year on the project for the development of an animal cemetery with the participation of the private sector.", "The reform of the Wholesale Farmers' Market is progressing well.", "A new system of payments to farmers was introduced.", "In the coming year there will be substantial investment in the acquisition of produce crates with an electronic chip, capable of providing clear tracing of any particular crate.", "An extensive programme of restructuring and renovation is underway at the public abattoir which had been left in a state of neglect for many years.", "During the coming year the old structures forming part of the old abattoir complex will be refurbished.", "Projects initiated in the fisheries sector to improve facilities for fishermen will continue.", "The ongoing works at the new wholesale fish market will proceed in the coming year so that, amongst other, a fish processing plant will be included 81 11: CREATING A JUST, EQUAL AND INCLUSIVE SOCIETY Right from the inception of this legislature we emphasized that social policy should be inclusive and offer various opportunities to different needs.", "We fully intend to continue the fight against abuse and make sure that social benefits are not paid to anyone not entitled to them.", "It would be the greatest injustice to those in real need, if benefits were to be paid to whoever is not entitled to receive them.", "At the same time, we will be investing more in aiding and delivering social justice to those in need who fully deserve our help.", "Unceasing work in the social field We understand that there are many who are in genuine need and are unable to work due to illness, disability and mental health problems.", "It is our duty to see that these persons and their families do not fall into the poverty trap.", "With this in mind, from the forthcoming year, the income of working children of such families will no longer be considered for the purposes of means testing of the head of the household.", "This means that the amount of \u20ac16.30 for each working child still residing in the family home will no longer be deducted from the social assistance payable.", "Strengthening Maltese families The family is at the centre of this Government's policy.", "Today, the concept of family is different from what it was, ten, twenty years ago.", "We were at the forefront in recognising the need for legislative reform so that our institutions would reflect these changes.", "82 After the introduction of parental leave for adopting parents, now we shall be offering support to couples who need to undergo IVF treatment.", "This will come into force by an entitlement to a number of days of leave following IVF intervention.", "The number of days will be specified following consultation.", "Hub for persons with disability Government is working on the concept of creating a hub equipped and adapted for persons with disability.", "The hub will not be an institution, but instead will promote inclusion and community participation.", "Apart from private residences, the hub will include a hostel, a respite centre, commercial outlets and all other necessary facilities, including a swimming pool, a day centre and underground parking.", "In Gozo, we are working with the private sector in the creation of jobs for persons with disability which would include document management.", "This process is reaching its conclusion.", "Project Just Society We shall continue with Project Just Society - a very ambitious commitment taken on by Government - to provide ten small homes within the community, thus giving reassurance to parents of persons with disability who worry about their children's future once they themselves pass away.", "The first of these homes in Siggiewi is completed and is already hosting the first group of residents.", "Another such home, in Gozo, is nearing completion, whilst applications for those in \u0126az-Zabbar and Pembroke are being considered by MEPA.", "The process relating to other homes, including the one in Pace Grasso, are at advanced stage.", "83 The Elderly In the light of an aging population, it comes as no surprise that demand for services and care of the elderly remains high.", "We shall therefore be increasing the expenditure and multiplying our efforts for the creation of more beds for the elderly in 2016.", "This is in addition to the carers pilot project announced earlier in this speech.", "Better structures for NGOs We are committed to improving the structures of funds allocated to non-governmental organisations engaged in the field of social welfare.", "Ex-Sea Malta seamen Talks are at an advanced stage between Government and ex-Sea Malta seamen with a view to concluding once and for all, the claim they still have pending before the law courts.", "Social Housing Today, the majority of families are homeowners.", "However, and for a variety of reasons, there is a considerable number of others who require assistance in acquiring decent housing.", "Apart from the programme of repairs of leased residences, the Housing Authority intends to continue its programme of even more extensive projects of repair and maintenance as well as the refurbishment and embellishment of various housing estates.", "Next year's programme includes projects in three localities: \u0126amrun, Ta' \u0120iorni and Pembroke.", "The Housing Authority is working on a plan calculated to meet the ever growing demand for social housing.", "Around 2900 applications are still pending before the Authority, many of them 84 several years old.", "The Housing Authority will embark on a \u20ac50 million project of new social housing in order to increase its stock.", "The project includes the restructuring of existing premises and the building of new premises already covered by MEPA permits, all of which will be within development zones.", "With a view to incentivising the rehabilitation and repair of old premises, the Housing Authority will be strengthening the existing two schemes with an increase of the grant given to residents who are entitled to be beneficiaries.", "In this regard, the Scheme for Subsidies for the Repair and Refurbishment of Owner-Occupied or Leased Residences will go up from \u20ac10,000 to \u20ac11,000, whilst the maximum grant under the \"Dangerous Structures Scheme\" will go up from \u20ac7,000 to \u20ac8,000.", "Compensation One of the measures announced in the Budget for 2014 was that all cases of compensation for expropriation not exceeding \u20ac15,000 (fifteen thousand Euros) were to be paid as a lump sum.", "Now, in the Budget for 2016, this measure is being extended to include all cases of compensation for expropriation up to a maximum of \u20ac50,000 (fifty thousand Euros), always subject to proof of title.", "It is estimated that this will mean dealing with cases involving around 200 plots.", "In addition to this, during the coming year, we shall continue to deal with the problem of Home Ownerships Schemes in cases where the families involved are unable to proceed with the signing of the final deed because the actual expropriation was never finalised by government and has been pending for decades 85 12: CONCLUSION Mr Speaker, This country is moving in the right direction, and this is not a coincidence.", "The people showed their confidence in our plan in a general election.", "They trusted we were able to create stability and provide a new direction with a clear roadmap for the country.", "Far from asking for a bailout, as some had suggested, today our country is becoming one of the fastest growing economies in Europe.", "From a country with a deficit of 3.7 per cent of GDP we are approaching a rate of 1.6 per cent.", "From a country with close to 8,000 unemployed, today we have a country with a record number of gainfully occupied.", "From a country with exaggerated utility bills, volatile prices of fuel and gas and a bankrupt Enemalta, to a country that has reduced utility costs for households and businesses by 25 per cent, achieved stability in fuel and gas pricing and a strong Enemalta.", "From a stagnant country with an administration incapable of taking decisions, to a country with an administration that is not afraid to take tough decisions.", "86 We have made big strides in becoming the best in Europe.", "We still have more to do.", "Much more.", "But all that will be achieved in this budget and the one to follow will in no way endanger the country's finances.", "This is because Malta has a strong economy.", "Annex A Single Rates From To Rate Deduct \u20ac 0 9,100 0.00% 0 9,101 14,500 15.00% 1,365
