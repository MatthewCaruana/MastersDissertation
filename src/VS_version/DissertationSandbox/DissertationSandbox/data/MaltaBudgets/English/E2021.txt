1. INTRODUCTION
Mr Speaker,
Today I am presenting my ninth budget on behalf of the 
Government. Over the past years a judicious Labour Government 
has managed to turn the economic tide. It has managed to make 
the economy prosper and achieve results never experienced 
by our country before. It has managed to cut down the debts 
piled up by others in the past. Above all it has managed to act 
according to the Maltese saying “Erfa’ u sorr għal meta tiġi 
bżonn”, which urges us to save for a rainy day.
That rainy day is here.
For the sake of those who sarcastically asked where the surplus 
is, I feel that in these past months we have amply demonstrated 
where the surplus has ended up. This Government has launched 
one financial package after another, through which it has 
boosted, like never before, our economy and the incomes of 
our families and 
businesses.
Mr Speaker, one might regard comparisons as odious. But 
at this point in time, the nation should stop for a while and 
compare what was handed out during the 2009 crisis to what 
is happening during the much larger crisis of today. Way back 
then, the Government of the day raised utility bills, whereas for 
a number of months now we have been paying out a monthly 
wage supplement of eight hundred euro (€800) to almost half 
the employees in the private sector.
2
Mr Speaker, whereas during the 2009 crisis others reneged on 
their electoral promise of reducing income tax, this Government 
has not only issued tax refund cheques, but added hundreds of 
euro in vouchers over and above, and also gave out a supplement 
to families on the In-Work Benefit scheme.
And if there are people who thought that, after the four financial 
packages already presented, this budget would now kick off an 
austerity period, I assure them that what we have accomplished 
to date was only the start of an economic policy that will see 
Malta being once again the fastest growing country in the 
European Union.
This Government is showing that it’s not a fair-weather sailor. 
Rather, we have prepared ourselves well for the storm. We have 
been prudent and judicious. Many naysayers used to question 
why we were so insistent on economic growth, and today you 
know precisely why. In recent years we have created the source 
of our resilience, thanks to which our country is now the one 
with the lowest unemployment rate in the Eurozone. Had we not 
developed our economy’s potential; had we not diversified our 
economic activity; had we continued with the debt habit of our 
predecessors rather than saving in the National Development 
and Social Fund (NDSF) and setting up the Malta Development 
Bank; had that been the case, rather than four aid packages, 
today we would have been doing like our predecessors: giving 
out a handful of energy-saving bulbs.
This crisis has hit our country at a time when the Government 
has reduced the national debt burden by half when compared 
to 2013; at a time when businesses and families have double 
3
the amount of bank deposits they had in 2013; at a time when 
our country has the lowest number of people eligible for social 
assistance, the lowest number of people on the unemployment 
register and the lowest rate of people at risk of poverty in our 
history.
Mr Speaker, I am so proud that, as the Minister for Finance, for 
the past years I have worked with my colleagues to arrive to this 
situation. It’s a situation which has enabled the Government to 
support businesses with an unprecedented level of assistance. 
A situation that meant that our families could retain their 
confidence. A situation where the allocation for Health has 
doubled within a few years. 
Over the past years, effecting the radical changes to our 
country’s economic and fiscal management has not been easy. It 
would have been much easier to lift our foot off the accelerator. 
It would have been much easier to turn a blind eye, like our 
predecessors did. It would have been much easier to turn to 
austerity in the face of the storm. 
Instead we have remained focused. We stayed on track, moving 
step by step in line with our long-term plan, drawn up when 
we were still in Opposition. We kept working hard, year after 
year, one budget after another, in order to afford to be more 
generous with our families and businesses. In order to provide 
free childcare. In order to introduce the in-work benefit. In order 
to introduce the tapering of benefits. In order to raise pensions. 
In order to lower taxes.
4
To the thousands of employees and business owners who are 
listening today, thank you for your efforts during the past months. 
You are the reason we are proud to be Maltese. Together we have 
confronted the greatest economic challenge that our country 
has ever faced. We have shown that the Maltese social model 
works. That at the height of the pandemic, for the first time in 
history, our country had the lowest unemployment rate in the 
Eurozone. That at the height of the pandemic, we were the 
only country registering an increase in employment. That at the 
height of the pandemic, rather than experiencing an increase in 
the number of people relying on social assistance, we had the 
largest increase in bank deposits in our history.
It therefore stands to reason to keep going in the same direction 
as the four packages we have already rolled out. It stands to 
reason to continue implementing the Electoral Manifesto.
1.1 The economic and financial context
Mr Speaker, as one might have expected, the closure of the 
airport, restaurants and non-essential shops and services has 
resulted in a reduction in the country’s production. In spite of 
this, the drop in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the first 
half of the year was lower than that across the Eurozone. While in 
Malta GDP fell by 7.7 per cent, in the Eurozone the corresponding 
reduction was of 9.0 per cent. 
The drop in GDP was reflected in a decrease in consumption, 
investment and net exports when compared to the first half of 
last year. On the other hand, public consumption increased. This 
5
was mainly due to an increase in expenditure in the health sector 
on account of the pandemic.
Thanks to the various schemes and measures we introduced, 
employees’ income was protected from the economic impact 
of COVID-19, as in the first half of this year wages and salaries 
increased by 5.8 per cent, translating into an increase of about 
one hundred sixty-four million euro (€164m). Measures such as 
the COVID-19 Wage Supplement, the tax deferral, the electricity 
bill refund, and the grant to cover rental costs were instrumental 
in safeguarding jobs and protecting employee income.
In August our country registered one of the lowest unemployment 
rates within the Eurozone. The rate of unemployment in Malta 
was 4.1 per cent, whereas the average across the Eurozone 
was 8.1 per cent. Over the same period, youth unemployment 
dropped as well, from 10.9 per cent in May to 9.5 per cent in 
August. Meanwhile the corresponding rate in August across the 
Eurozone was 18.1 per cent.
Right from the start this Government has sought to diversify the 
Maltese economy so that Malta’s economic growth would not 
be dependent on any one sector. Thanks to these efforts, the 
impact on the Gross Value Added was not as severe as it would 
have been had our country not been economically diversified. 
In fact, the decrease in our Gross Value Added was lower than 
the average reduction in Gross Value Added in the European 
Union and the Eurozone.
6
This was a reflection of the fact that although tourism-related 
sectors such as retail, catering, accommodation and transport 
registered substantial reductions, sectors such as information 
and communication, the arts, entertainment and recreation, 
including gaming and real estate, registered increases in Gross 
Value Added.
Inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices (HICP) dropped to 0.5 per cent in September of this year, 
as the country was registering lower  inflation levels month by 
month, while inflation measured by the Retail Price Index (RPI) 
went down to 0.18 per cent.
Mr Speaker, last year this Government managed to register a 
surplus for the fourth consecutive year, and this state of affairs 
helped our country to be prepared. Today is not the time for 
a surplus; it’s the time to keep supporting our families and 
businesses. This year we need to spend more than we are 
bringing in. We can do this because we can afford to. We are 
doing this to safeguard families, jobs and businesses.
As a result, in the current year our country expects to register a 
deficit of 9.4 per cent of GDP. The national debt, which stood at 
44.4 per cent of GDP in the first quarter of this year, is expected 
to increase to 55 per cent. 
1.2 The economic and fiscal projections
Mr Speaker,
This year the economies of the European Union and the Eurozone 
7
are expected to contract by 8.3 per cent and 8.7 per cent 
respectively. Next year, the EU economy is forecast to grow by 
an average of 5.8 per cent, while the Eurozone is expected to 
grow by 6.1 per cent.
In Malta we are forecasting a real reduction in GDP of 7.4 per 
cent this year. However, this reduction is expected to start 
being recovered as from next year, when the Maltese economy 
is projected to register growth of 5.0 per cent in real terms and 
6.4 per cent in nominal terms.
Such growth is expected to be fuelled by a 7.5 per cent increase 
in investment and a 3.7 per cent increase in private consumption. 
Exports are also anticipated to contribute to this growth, 
with an increase in 5.5 per cent, while imports are expected 
to increase at a lower rate of 4.5 per cent. On the other hand, 
public consumption is projected to drop by 1.2 per cent, when 
calculated on this year’s basis.
This growth forecast means that next year we are expecting 
to see a 2.3 per cent increase in employment, while the 
unemployment level should remain relatively low at the rate of 
4.0 per cent. Inflation is projected at 1.3 per cent.
As regards public finances for 2021, we are forecasting the deficit 
to drop to 5.9 per cent of the GDP, while the debt level is set to 
increase to 58.6 per cent of the GDP.
Table 1.4 presents the results of the risk analysis related to these 
economic and financial forecasts.

Table 1.4: Sensitivity Analysis of the Economic and Fiscal
Forecasts
The sensitivity analysis is in line with the requirements 
of Council Directive 2011/85/EU on the requirements for 
budgetary frameworks of the Member States and also in 
line with the requirements of Article 17(1) of the Fiscal 
Responsibility Act.
As per Article 16(2)g, the sensitivity analysis of 
the budgetary targets was carried out based on 
objective criteria, taking account possible changes 
in macroeconomic conditions, including growth and 
interest rates. The sensitivity analysis is guided by the 
performance of past forecasts and considers relevant 
risk scenarios.
On balance, the indicator points towards some upside 
risks for the macroeconomic forecasts for 2020 and a 
marginal downside risk in 2021. The result is consistent 
with the analysis of alternative model forecasts. The 
balance of risks on the fiscal balance is on the upside in 
both 2020 and 2021. 
Compared to the baseline scenario, alternative output 
gap projections range from -1.6 percentage points to 3.5 
percentage points in 2020 and -0.3 percentage points 
to 0.6 percentage points in 2021.
12
A full description of the exercise including the assumptions 
underpinning the forecasts and the seven alternative 
model-based growth scenarios maybe found in the 
Draft Budgetary Plan submitted to the Commission 
and uploaded on the Ministry for Finance and Financial 
Services website.

2. IMPROVING FURTHER THE QUALITY OF LIFE
Mr Speaker,
By means of this budget, the Government is showing that it 
intends to remain focused on the execution of its plan to ensure 
that the wealth generated by the country is spread widely across 
society. Through the budgets we have presented in the past years 
we have reinforced the social benefits framework and concretely 
helped pensioners, elderly persons, and persons with disability, 
while looking after employees, their families and their children.
The Government is set to continue pursuing its programme of 
social betterment, targeted mainly at the most vulnerable and 
those at risk of poverty, but it will also see that each and every 
segment of society, including the middle one, benefits from the 
wealth it creates and stimulates in our country.
2.1 Cost of living adjustment
The cost of living adjustment, which is calculated according to a 
formula agreed upon by all the social partners within the MCESD, 
will be one euro and seventy-five cents (€1.75) per week. This 
increase reflects the low level of inflation experienced over the 
last twelve months.
This increase will be granted to all employees, as well as 
pensioners and those on social benefits. Student stipends will 
also be increased pro rata.
14
2.2 Vacation leave in relation to public holidays
Mr Speaker, as we have done in preceding budgets, in today’s 
budget we are continuing  to implement our electoral promise 
of giving back, as vacation leave, the public holidays falling 
on a weekend, which had been taken away from employees 
during previous administrations. Accordingly, in 2021 employees’ 
vacation leave entitlement will once again be increased by 
an additional day. This is another measure which will further 
enhance the quality of life of all our families. 
2.3 Increased tax refund
Mr Speaker,
The tax refund granted during the past three years will once 
again be granted next year, at higher rates. The tax refund value 
will now increase to between €45 and €95 (see Table 2.1). The 
highest amounts will be granted to those with the lowest income 
levels. 
This measure will benefit over two hundred eighteen thousand 
(218,000) people and will cost the Government almost sixteen 
million euro (€16m).
2.4 Stimulating economic activity for everyone
Without any doubt, the introduction of the vouchers scheme 
has contributed greatly to the revival of economic activity in 
restaurants, hotels and retail shops across Malta and Gozo. 
It is therefore with pleasure that I announce that we will be 
launching a fresh scheme for next year, this time with the one 
15
hundred euro vouchers being split into €60 redeemable in 
accommodation, hotels or restaurants, and the remaining €40 
redeemable in shops or services. The vouchers will be distributed 
to all those who would have turned 16 by the end of this year. 
Further details about this scheme will be announced at a later 
date. This measure will cost fifty million euro (€50m).
2.5 Further improvements to the Children’s Allowance
For the first time after eleven years, last year we increased the 
Children’s Allowance rates for low- and medium-income families. 
To keep building on this improvement, as from next year we will 
be introducing a new concept along with the payment of this 
benefit, so that families entitled to the Children’s Allowance are 
given more help in coping with the costs of raising children. This 
measure will take the form of an additional supplement which 
will be paid in respect of each child in the family.
Where the family’s income does not exceed twenty-five 
thousand, three hundred and eighteen euro (€25,318) per annum, 
the amount of this supplement will be of seventy euro (€70) 
per year for each child. On the other hand, for all other families 
whose income exceeds this amount, the supplement will be of 
fifty euro (€50) per year for each child.
Accordingly, for a typical family with two children under the age 
of 16, if the family income does not exceed twenty-five thousand, 
three hundred and eighteen euro (€25,318) per annum, it will 
benefit from an increase of €140 per annum, whereas if the 
16
income is higher than this amount, it is entitled to an increase 
of €100. 
This measure, which will cost the Government over €3 million 
euro, will benefit more than 40,000 families with a total of 
60,500 children.
2.6 Improved In-Work Benefits
In the budget for 2015, we introduced the In-Work Benefit 
with the aim of boosting low incomes, while at the same time 
incentivising work among families. The introduction of this 
benefit was successful as, together with the other measures 
of the Making Work Pay initiative, it helped Malta surpass the 
European Union average labour force participation rate in 2018, 
while social dependence decreased by half. Year on year we 
continued improving this benefit, with the last improvement 
effected just this year in terms of the Economic Regeneration 
Plan announced in June.
We will continue to boost this benefit in this budget, as we 
are once again extending the thresholds so that more families 
become eligible. 
For couples where both work, the threshold will go up to 
€35,000. For single parents who work, the threshold is increasing 
to €23,000. For couples where only one parent works, the 
threshold will go up to €26,000.
17
2.7 Increase in the Allowance for the Care of Children
under a Care Order 
The Government appreciates the commitment and dedication 
of families that foster children who are under a Care Order, and 
that feel obliged to do whatever is needed for the children to 
have the best possible care and quality of life, as if they were 
their own. 
Consequently, we are once again increasing the Foster Care 
Allowance such that, with effect from January, the benefit 
payable will go up by five hundred and twenty euro (€520) per 
annum, to a total of five thousand, seven hundred and twenty 
euro (€5,720).
2.8 Grant for couples who adopt a child locally
As from next year we will also be giving couples who adopt 
children locally the opportunity to benefit from the Adoption 
Grant we launched in 2018. This is being done to help families 
cope with the expenses related to the adoption process. The 
maximum grant payable is one thousand euro (€1,000).
2.9 Pension increases
Mr Speaker,
This is a Government that respects pensioners and demonstrates 
this through its actions. I am glad to announce that once again, 
in addition to the COLA increase, pensioners will be getting yet 
another increase of three euro and twenty-five cents (€3.25) per 
week, which together with the cost of living adjustment adds 
up to five euro (€5) per week. This translates into an increase 
18
of two hundred and sixty euro (€260) each year for all social 
security pensioners, that is all those on a retirement pension, 
a widows’ pension, an invalidity pension, or a non-contributory 
age pension. This measure will benefit ninety-three thousand 
(93,000) pensioners.
We would like to point out that, excluding the COLA, all the 
increases granted to pensioners throughout this legislature add 
up to €11.25 per week, and have thus exceeded by far the €8 per 
week promised in the Electoral Manifesto.
2.10 Adjustment of tax exemption on pensions
We are once again raising the maximum pension income that is 
exempt from income tax, so that the increases in pensions we 
are granting (including the COLA increase) will not be taxable 
next year. The tax exemption cap is being raised to fourteen 
thousand and fifty-eight euro (€14,058). 
Furthermore, for married couples who both receive a pension 
and who apply a married tax computation, the other  income that 
is exempt from income tax will increase to three thousand, six 
hundred euro (€3,600). Thus, as from next year, these pensioners 
will benefit from tax savings of up to seven hundred and forty-
four euro (€744). (See Table 2.2)
2.11 Higher payments for beneficiaries of Supplementary
Assistance 
In 2017 we made an important reform in the Supplementary 
Assistance that is paid to low-income couples and single persons. 
19
Through this reform we had significantly raised the income 
thresholds for couples and persons to qualify for the assistance, 
and also increased the rates payable to couples.
In the new year we will continue implementing the reform to 
the benefit of around twenty-nine thousand (29,000) people.
Next year we will update the mechanism used to calculate the 
supplementary assistance rates, and the maximum of such rates, 
as worked out according to one’s income and marital status, is 
set to increase between 70 euro and 108 euro.
Furthermore, the additional supplement of 150 euro that we 
started giving out this year to persons aged sixty-five and 
over who are at risk of poverty, will now be paid without 
distinction to all persons aged 65 years and over who qualify 
for supplementary assistance.
In total this measure will cost about two million euro (€2m) per 
year.
2.12 A further increase for elderly persons who do not
qualify for any pension 
Persons aged sixty-three (63) or over, particularly women, who 
spent many years out of employment in the past and are not 
entitled to a pension even though they might have paid some 
social security contributions, for the third time will be given a 
further increase of fifty euro in their annual bonus. Persons who 
paid less than five years’ social security contributions will now 
20
receive a bonus of 250 euro, whereas for those who paid more 
than five years’ contributions the bonus will go up to 350 euro.
This measure will benefit around eleven thousand (11,000) 
people, mainly women who for some reason or other withdrew 
from the labour market.
It is to be noted that elderly persons who live in their own home 
or in a private residential home will continue to receive a grant 
of €300 if they are aged 75 and over, or €350 if they are aged 
80 and over.
2.13 Justice for persons who paid social security
contributions before reaching the age of 19
As from next year, persons born before 1962 and who do not 
qualify for a pension when taking into account the contributions 
paid after the age of 19, will have any contributions paid before 
19 years of age taken into account, and if the required minimum 
is reached, the person will then qualify for a reduced minimum 
pension.
2.14 Recognition as widow/widower for those in a civil
union or cohabitation 
In the light of the provisions of the respective laws on Civil 
Unions and Cohabitation, we are updating the definition of a 
widow as it stands in our social security legislation. By virtue of 
this amendment, in the event of the death of one of the parties, 
persons who were in a civil union or in a registered cohabitation 
21
will be recognised as widows/widowers of their cohabitant or 
partner.
The amendment will also cater for those circumstances where 
due to the death of one of the parties outside marriage or civil 
union, the cohabitation was not contracted and registered in 
time whether under the first Act or the second Act.
2.15 Service pensioners
Once again we are increasing by €200 the amount of service 
pension that will not be considered for the purposes of the social 
security pension assessment, such that the exempted amount 
for 2021 will increase to two thousand, eight hundred and sixty-
six euro (€2,866).
Service pensioners who during the year reach the age of 72 will 
also start benefiting from an improvement in their social security 
pension. This is because when their pension is calculated, only 
twenty-five per cent of their service pension amount will be 
taken into account.
2.16 Increasing the Carer at Home rate 
The Carer at Home scheme we launched in 2015 was a successful 
one. Year after year we have seen an increase in the number of 
elderly persons who choose to keep living in their own home 
while employing someone on a full time or part time basis to 
take care of them.
22
By way of encouragement and in order to help these elderly 
persons cope better with the costs, we will be increasing the 
maximum annual subsidy amount they are granted by just over 
€700, taking the benefit up from five thousand, two hundred 
and ninety-one euro (€5,291) to €6,000.
2.17 Widening of the eligibility criteria for carer benefits 
Since the introduction of the carer benefit, the number of 
persons who take care of their relatives in the same residence 
has increased to around one thousand five hundred (1,500).
To date retired persons have been excluded from qualification 
for these benefits, known as the Increased Carers Allowance and 
the Carers Allowance. As from next year, we will be widening the 
relative eligibility criteria to give these persons the opportunity 
to qualify for this benefit, provided that the person under their 
care is not their spouse, and provided also that they undergo 
a periodical medical examination to ascertain that they are 
physically and mentally fit to provide such care.
2.18 Severe disability assistance 
The commitment towards persons with disability remains at 
the heart of this Government’s social policy. We implemented 
measures that have made a difference in these people’s lives, 
particularly by reforming the assistance granted to persons 
whose disability impedes them from finding a job. Next year we 
will be raising the parameters of the Barthel Index from eight to 
nine, and we will adjust the parameters for intellectual disability 
23
conditions so that more persons with some form of disability 
and unable to work can become eligible for increased assistance.
2.19 Introduction of a Carer Grant 
In continuation with this reform of benefits for carers, as 
promised in the electoral programme, as from January we will 
be introducing a new benefit for parents who have to leave their 
employment to take care of a disabled child over the age of 16 
and who are entitled to Increased Severe Disability Assistance. 
The new benefit, termed Carer Grant, will be of €300 per annum. 
2.20 Continuing to address past injustices
Mr Speaker, this Government has honoured its promise to around 
8,000 beneficiaries or their heirs, by continuing to address the 
employment injustices they suffered in the past.
The current year will be the last one in which police officers will 
receive compensation in accordance with an agreement reached 
with their representatives.
Throughout 2021 we will carry on with the schemes designed 
for the other categories of ex-employees. To this end we are 
allocating an additional sum of over 9 million euro to hand out 
grants to former members of the forces (korpi) who were later 
employed with the public service or the public sector, and to ex-
port workers and their heirs. The public sector scheme applies 
also to the former workers of the Gas Board who moved to 
Enemalta Corporation when this was set up in 1977, as well as a 
small group of workers who had been engaged as apprentices 
24
with the Malta Electricity Board and were later transferred to 
Enemalta.
Next year this initiative will benefit around five thousand, five 
hundred (5,500) people in all. 
2.21 Ex-Dockyard workers who suffered from the
Asbestosis condition 
Over the past months, my Ministry has been in discussions 
with several ex-Dockyard employees who, due to the work 
assigned to them at their workplace, went on to suffer from the 
Asbestosis condition. As the employer of these former workers, 
the Government expects that, once all facts are in hand, it will 
arrive to a compensation for these individuals or to the heirs of 
such ex-employees.
2.22 Free Tal-Linja Card for elderly persons aged 70+
Mr Speaker, having just this year increased the number of persons 
eligible for free public transport, next year we will continue 
extending the free Tal-Linja Card initiative to include more elderly 
persons. At present, an elderly person has to be seventy-five 
(75) years old or above to benefit from free public transport. 
This threshold will now be lowered to seventy (70) years and 
over. Around nineteen thousand (19,000) elderly persons will 
benefit from this measure.
2.23 Government Savings Bonds for pensioners 
In the four years since we started issuing the 62+ Savings 
Bonds, which carry a much higher interest rate than that paid 
25
by commercial banks, over twenty-seven thousand, five hundred 
(27,500) pensioners invested just under €400 million in these 
bond issues.
Consequently, since fixed deposit interest rates have remained 
low, this year we will be issuing these Bonds once again. It is 
expected that around six thousand (6,000) elderly persons will 
be newly eligible for this bond issue.
2.24 Improved fiscal incentives for private pensions 
The fiscal incentives we introduced six years ago, which were 
applicable to individuals who invest in a private pension (known 
as a Third Pillar Pension Scheme), as well as to employers offering 
a voluntary scheme that is non-contributory on the part of the 
employee (a Voluntary Occupational Pension Scheme), are 
bearing fruit. In fact, eleven thousand (11,000) beneficiaries have 
already invested in a Third Pillar Pension, while two thousand 
(2,000) employees and employers have invested in a Voluntary 
Occupational Pension Scheme.
For next year the amount of annual financial investment upon 
which a tax exemption applies is being increased by €1,000 (see 
Table 2.3), bringing the tax-exempt value up to €3,000 per year.
2.25 Extension of existing schemes on the sale and
purchase of property 
Mr Speaker, I am pleased to announce that the existing schemes 
that we introduced over the past years are being extended for 
yet another year. Here I am referring to the schemes entailing a 
26
reduction in stamp duty for First Time Buyers; that for Second 
Time Buyers; the scheme for the purchase of vacant properties 
in Urban Conservation Areas (UCA); that for the purchase of 
property in Gozo; as well as the refund schemes for restoration 
expenses.
Furthermore, with effect from tomorrow, First Time Buyers will 
be exempt from stamp duty on the first two hundred thousand 
euro (€200,000) rather than on the first one hundred seventy-
five thousand euro (€175,000). I am also announcing that the 
reduced rate of 3.5 per cent in the case of acquisition of one’s 
own residential property, even if not a first time buyer, and in 
the case of inheritance of the property in which one already 
resides, will also now apply on the first two hundred thousand 
euro (€200,000).
In addition, the measures introduced by the Economic 
Regeneration Plan, whereby the stamp duty on property 
acquisition was reduced from five per cent (5%) to one point 
five per cent (1.5%) on the first four hundred thousand euro 
(€400,000) of the property value, as well as the reduction in the 
capital gains tax payable by the seller from eight per cent (8%) 
to five per cent (5%), will remain in force. This applies to promise 
of sale agreements registered up to 31 March 2021 as long as 
the contract is entered into by not later than 31 December 2021.
2.26 Reduction in the tax payable on property granted
by donation 
In this Budget we will be extending the tax-exempt amount 
applicable when a property is donated by parents to their 
27
children, where the property is to be used by the children as 
their residence. Such amount will increase from two hundred 
thousand euro (€200,000) to two hundred fifty thousand euro 
(€250,000). Any additional property value over and above will 
continue being taxed at 3.5 per cent.
2.27 Assistance for home ownership and rent benefits 
The Equity Sharing Scheme which we introduced for those 
under forty years of age and the other one for those who have 
turned forty, as well as the rent benefits on social housing and 
affordable housing, will be continued.
With regard to the Equity Release Scheme, it is expected that 
such products will start being offered by the market following 
the coming into force of the relative laws and regulations as 
from September of last year. 
A problem concerning a substantial number of families, 
especially those who bought their ordinary residence or garage 
from third parties, is where there is a discrepancy between the 
plans annexed to the contract and the existing building. As a 
result, such families would be unable to transfer their ordinary 
residence.
These families will be given the opportunity to regularise their 
position by means of a scheme to be launched in the coming year.
28
2.28 Tax on transfer of property under the promise of an
assignment right
From 1 January until 31 December of next year, the final tax rate 
of 15 per cent payable on profits or gains from the assignment of 
any rights acquired in terms of a promise of sale (konvenju) will 
be extended to apply to the entire amount. Over this period the 
performance of this measure will be evaluated before deciding 
on its future.
2.29 Concession on transfer of business
We want family businesses to keep going strong from one 
generation to the next. It was in this context that two years 
ago we introduced a measure whereby we reduced the duty 
payable on the transfer of a business to 1.5 per cent. Thanks 
to this initiative, over three years the Government has helped 
family businesses with tax savings of over twenty-three million 
euro (€23m).
I would like to announce that this measure is being extended by 
a further year, at a cost of seven and a half million euro (€7.5m).
2.30 Withholding tax on royalties derived from the sale
of books
With a view to encouraging more writers to publish their literary 
works and hence broaden our country’s cultural heritage, as from 
next year any income earned by an author as royalties, on the 
sale of books of which he/she is the author or co-author, will be 
subject to a final withholding tax of 15 per cent.

3. INCENTIVISING ECONOMIC GROWTH
3.1 A plan for the recovery and transformation of the
economy 
Mr Speaker,
This budget will continue to incentivise economic growth.
Economic growth was, and will remain, the source of all the 
wealth through which the Government keeps increasing 
pensions, reducing poverty, spending more on health including 
free medicines, and continuing to raise the education level, while 
above all preparing for any crisis that our country may face, as 
is currently the case.
Further to the pandemic experience, in future more attention 
will be given to seeing that this growth leads to a better 
quality of life for our families. This means, first of all, that both 
public and private economic activity must be conducted with 
good governance. Secondly, we will ensure that this growth is 
underpinned by Green Economy principles, involving the least 
possible negative impact on the environment, the air, water, the 
sea and land use, as well as lower waste generation per capita. 
Above all, over a span of thirty years we will gradually reduce 
our dependence on energy from traditional sources which are 
leading to climate change. Our aim is that by 2050 our country 
will be carbon-free.
Thirdly, we will insist on innovation and take advantage of digital 
technology in all sectors of our economy. This is the only way 
in which our country, which lacks natural resources, can remain 
33
competitive and at the forefront in terms of economic growth. 
To achieve this, we need to significantly boost our investment 
in infrastructure in its broadest sense.
In this budget we will show how we intend to embark on the 
long journey to reach these aims, primarily towards a sustainable 
economy built on a green and digital economy.
3.2 Continuing to safeguard employment 
Mr Speaker,
First of all, however, we need to ensure that our economy, our 
businesses and our employees remain economically healthy 
throughout these difficult times, so that when the pandemic is 
over, not only would we be able to continue where we left off 
in terms of growth and distribution of national wealth, but we 
would also be well-prepared for future challenges.
To date, thanks to the COVID Wage Supplement, we have 
safeguarded around one hundred thousand (100,000) jobs 
and we have given assistance to more than twenty thousand 
(20,000) companies. The Government is continuously analysing 
economic performance and adapting measures as needed.
Accordingly, further to discussions held with various social 
partners, we will be extending this assistance until the end of 
March 2021. Now that we have more experience of this measure’s 
performance as well as more data, we are in a position to modify 
it to ensure that more assistance is directed towards those who 
34
need it most, through the application of clear criteria, primarily 
business turnover. 
It is expected that expenditure on this scheme will reach up to 
€40 million per month.
In terms of the Economic Regeneration Plan, we announced 
various measures aimed at improving business liquidity, 
including tax deferrals, moratoria, bank loans guaranteed by the 
Government, and interest rate subsidies. All these will remain 
in force as announced. Towards the end of March 2021, an 
evaluation of these measures will be carried out in consultation 
with the social partners.
As a government we will remain with our fingers on the pulse 
of the industry and small businesses, and we will sustain our 
efforts to enter new economic sectors and update our country’s 
industrial infrastructure, in a way that reflects not just the needs 
and challenges of today, but also those of the future.
Although our economy has a solid base, to preserve its resilience 
and competitiveness we will be drawing up a plan with a clear 
vision for the Maltese economy over the ten years ahead, coupled 
with a strategy focusing on the coming three years.
Furthermore, Malta Enterprise will be supporting the productive 
investment sector through innovative schemes.
35
3.3 €2.25 billion in European funds for Malta and Gozo 
The outcome of the Summit held between European leaders last 
July led to the Government of Malta securing a funding allocation 
for Malta and Gozo to the tune of over two billion euro.
These funds are spread over various programmes financed from 
the EU’s traditional budget (MFF) and from new instruments 
of recovery and transition (RFF) launched by the European 
Commission against the backdrop of huge environmental 
challenges and the COVID-19 crisis.
The Maltese Government intends to use these funds to keep 
boosting investment in areas such as the environment; climate 
change; research; innovation and digital technology; education; 
our country’s security; the social sector; and agriculture and 
fisheries, among others.
We will keep working to carry out projects supported by 
European funds such as ERASMUS+ and HORIZON 2020. By 
means of the ‘Connecting Europe Facility’ (CEF) fund, Malta will 
be implementing the Clean Air project at the Grand Harbour and 
the ship-to-shore energy project for the Freeport.
The Government is allocating around one hundred twenty 
million euro (€120m) in European funds, secured under the new 
programme ReactEU and other European funds, to continue 
supporting jobs hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
But our work does not stop with the pandemic. Thus, in the 
coming months the Government will be preparing a programme 
36
of around two hundred twenty million euro (€220m) in grants 
under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) for investment 
in, among others, the environment and climate sectors, as well 
as the change towards a more digital reality. In this way we will 
be better prepared to address the challenges of the future.
3.4 An innovative economy
In order to continue consolidating capital investment in the 
digital sector, we will be working with the consultative body 
‘Digital Economy Think Tank’ to reformulate the Digital Strategy 
for Malta, to take into account new developments in this field.
I must mention that significant investment is being made in 
cybersecurity in order to give citizens peace of mind while using 
such technology.
Our country’s vision in the technological field must include 
research and innovation, and incorporate the adoption of 
innovative and future-oriented technologies, such as Virtual 
Reality; Augmented Reality; Immersive Technology; 3d printing; 
Quantum and High Performance Computing. Next year we 
will continue implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) projects, 
including in sectors such as education, health and transport.
In the area of Esports and video game development, besides 
attracting operators, we will see that students are trained to 
gain the skills and be able to start a career in the video game 
development industry.
37
Sectors which are operating successfully, like gaming and 
Blockchain, need to be supported and built upon, in the light 
of their ever-increasing importance in our country’s economic 
model.
To complement this, we will make sure to invest in human capital 
by continuing to train citizens, workers and our children, in terms 
of both upskilling and reskilling.
3.5 Attracting start-ups to Malta 
Start-ups are the key to a growing vibrant economy. A framework 
is therefore being designed to make Malta attractive for start-
ups wishing to operate in Europe. This framework will be 
complemented by a Government fund which will be invested in 
Venture Capital Funds aimed at establishing such an industry 
in Malta.
3.6 Increase in the VAT exempt threshold 
In order to give a further boost to small operators including the 
self-employed, at a time when these have shown great resilience, 
we are once again increasing the VAT exempt threshold, from 
twenty thousand euro (€20,000) to thirty thousand euro 
(€30,000). This measure will cut down on bureaucracy for these 
operators.
3.7 Online sales for businesses 
We will continue working to help businesses sell online. We 
want to encourage more businesses to be organised and set up 
38
for online sales, as well as to integrate their systems with other 
distribution systems.
3.8 Supporting consolidation, renewal and innovation in
industry 
Malta Enterprise will be launching a new scheme to encourage 
companies employing less than fifty (50) employees to embark 
on innovation projects. This scheme will support technological 
investments to improve company operations, improve 
efficiencies, reduce operating costs, venture into new markets, 
and employ qualified people to safeguard the sustainability of 
the enterprise. The scheme will be open for a definite period of 
one year and will cover up to 50 per cent of the outlay up to a 
maximum of two hundred thousand euro (€200,000) for each 
company. Collaboration with local or international research 
institutions increases the level of available assistance by thirty-
five thousand euro (€35,000).
3.9 New foreign investment and other schemes 
Malta Enterprise will continue to fuel economic growth by 
extending, reinforcing and launching various schemes, both to 
help economic sectors that are already operating in Malta as 
well as to attract new investment. Among such schemes one 
can mention the Micro Invest scheme; the Business Development 
and Continuity Scheme; the Research and Development 2020 
Scheme; the R&D Feasibility Study Scheme; and the Business 
Start scheme. 
39
Promotion efforts will be made to encourage more companies to 
use technologies like the Internet of Things in their operations, 
alongside initiatives to encourage Maltese and Gozitan 
consumers to buy Maltese products.
Our country needs to continue creating and facilitating direct 
investment by ensuring that as a Government we use the 
tools available under the European Commission’s Temporary 
Framework, while facilitating industry access to loan and 
tax credit schemes to attract new investment as well as to 
consolidate existing Malta-based operations.
3.10 Consumer protection 
We are investing to continue ensuring consumer protection, 
namely by improving the national laboratories’ facilities, including 
those used for the purposes of surveillance and quality testing of 
medicines; facilitating further the alternative dispute resolution 
process for consumers and business owners; and setting up of 
an e-Enforcement Unit.
3.11 The aviation and maritime sectors
The Government is determined to see that the success achieved 
in the maritime sector is replicated in the aviation sector. For 
this purpose, the relative laws have been amended to attract 
new operators to Malta, while companies already set up here 
expand their operations further.
40
The Aviation Policy is being launched with the setting up of a 
Stakeholders Forum, which will include representatives of all 
those involved in the aviation sector.
In the maritime field we will keep working to strengthen the 
Maritime Register, as well as to increase promotion for the Super 
Yachts sector to see this industry attracting more yachts of this 
type to our shores.
We are aware of the environmental risks caused by the occurrence 
of maritime accidents, and therefore we will be ensuring that 
the necessary support is given to initiate the implementation 
measures under the National Marine Pollution Contingency Plan.
3.12 Air Malta
Air Malta was, is still, and will remain one of the most important 
pillars of the Maltese economy. We could see evidence of this 
throughout this pandemic, when Air Malta operated a lifeline 
schedule so that our country could remain connected to the 
rest of Europe, and in that way we ensured that Maltese people 
stranded abroad could be returned back home.
It’s a known fact that during the COVID-19 pandemic the aviation 
sector was the hardest hit. Consequently, as a Government we 
will pitch in to help Air Malta recover part of the losses it suffered 
due to the pandemic, and thus in the coming days we will be 
filing a State Aid request to the European Commission.
41
3.13 Rebuilding the tourism sector 
Tourism is a key pillar in the Maltese socioeconomic context, 
making a substantial contribution to the creation of wealth and 
employment.
The impact of the pandemic was devastating for this sector and, 
along with it, all the other sectors which this industry interacts 
with or supports, directly or indirectly. Overnight these sectors 
saw their income dwindle down to a trickle.
As already mentioned, this Government will keep assisting those 
sectors, like the tourism sector, going through this difficult 
moment. Our main aim for next year will be to work relentlessly 
to recover as much as we can out of what we lost. The challenges 
are steep. We will be competing for much lower numbers of 
global travellers, but we will be ready to get back on course and 
return to the scenario we were used to until last year, when our 
results consistently exceeded international averages.
In view of this, over the coming weeks we will be launching an 
updated strategy for the development of our tourism sector, 
based on the principles of a new start for the industry, laid on 
more sustainable and competitive foundations, and aiming for 
higher quality. This strategy should take us through until 2030.
3.14 Helping the tourism industry move towards Net Zero,
Carbon Neutral 
Society is increasingly becoming aware of the impact of our 
actions on the environment we live in. Consequently, we have 
42
started working on a long-term implementation plan so that 
the tourism industry could transition its operations to net zero, 
carbon neutral. Our vision is that every tourism establishment 
in our country, big or small, should start generating enough 
energy from clean sources, while reducing consumption through 
investment in innovative technologies.
3.15 Digital investment in the tourism sector 
We will see that digitalisation is introduced in the tourism field 
as well. This should present opportunities for businesses to keep 
expanding their market reach, boost growth, improve operational 
efficiencies, and increase their competitive advantage.
3.16 Events, marketing and security
We will be putting together an incentive package for international 
promotion to attract tourists to Malta and to finance the 
organisation of a number of events, which would be spread 
out throughout the year to reduce the seasonality impact. In 
addition, we will be working to restore and stimulate the all-
important Conferences and Incentives sector.
We are set to keep improving our tourism product, which includes 
also the regeneration and maintenance of tourism zones. In this 
respect, in the coming year we will launch a design contest with 
the aim of drawing up a holistic plan for the regeneration of 
several tourism zones.
With regards to security, we will continue working to develop 
the Safe City concept, with Paceville set to be the first zone to 
43
adopt this idea. Over the past months work has been underway 
with the police, focusing both on the technical aspect as well 
as on operation within the legal framework, for this zone to be 
protected by means of CCTV cameras.
3.17 Measures to address the realities of Gozo 
Mr Speaker, this Government has always given top priority to 
the Gozitan people, and it will keep doing so. We will continue 
to provide the necessary stimulus so that the economic success 
achieved in Gozo – leading it to register higher economic growth 
than Malta and a drop in unemployment – is sustained in the 
coming years.
We are committed to ensure that Gozo continues to diversify 
its economic activity and reduce its dependence on the public 
sector and on tourism. At the same time, we will keep investing 
to establish a research centre and premises for the launch and 
execution of pilot projects in advanced technology. All the while 
we will keep embracing the concept that Gozo should remain 
an ecological island and flourish with projects that complement 
the vision of a sustainable environment.
And without doubt, both the Standing Committee for Gozo 
Affairs as well as the Gozo Regional Development Authority, 
both institutions set up by this Government, will keep lending 
their support so that this vision for Gozo is fulfilled.
44
3.18 Incentives for the creation of jobs in Gozo 
New employment opportunities with high value added will be 
created with the introduction of the second fibre optic cable; the 
Xewkija Innovation Hub; and the ongoing work on the National 
Astronomical Observatory in the Qortin area of Nadur.
In the traditional sectors of agriculture and fisheries, we will be 
overseeing the introduction of a number of initiatives aimed at 
making these sectors more sustainable through diversification 
of operations.
The various schemes implemented over the past years, which 
stimulated the creation of more work in Gozo, will be continued. 
Thus, we will be extending the Employment Refund Scheme; 
the Teleworking Scheme; and the MICE-related schemes. The 
Back Office Employment Refund Scheme and the schemes for 
promotional support to Gozitan enterprises, particularly those 
operating in the digital innovation, internet technology and 
tourism sectors, will be enhanced to achieve better results. More 
details will be announced at a later date. 
Throughout the coming year, work will proceed on the 
renovation and necessary upgrade of the ICT infrastructure 
at the Administrative Building of the Gozo Ministry. Once this 
project is completed, it will provide employees and clients with 
a modern welcoming environment, with due care to workplace 
health and safety aspects.
45
3.19 Infrastructural works in Gozo
Infrastructural work on the rebuilding of arterial and other roads 
will be continued. As part of landscaping, restoration works will 
be carried out on the statues and niches that are dotted around 
the Gozitan streets and countryside. Mosaic murals will also be 
installed in tourism zones and infrastructural works will be carried 
out in the Blue Lagoon area in Comino.
Powered by Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things 
technology, the smart parking project will be extended to cover 
more parking areas and streets around Gozo, enabling drivers 
to be aware of the availability and location of parking spots at 
any point in time.
Work on the building of an Aquatic Centre will be continued. 
In addition to the Olympic pool, this project incorporates the 
restoration and addition of more sports facilities at the Sports 
Pavilion. The technical infrastructure at the horse racing track 
in Tax-Xħajma will be upgraded.
The Diving Master Plan, drawn up years ago, is set to be updated 
and renewed to reflect the current and future needs of this leisure 
activity and tourism niche.
The necessary studies will be undertaken leading to the eventual 
implementation of the underwater cultural museum, which 
should be the first of its kind on the island. The Virtual Reality 
project at the Ċittadella is also being carried out, eventually 
enabling visitors to experience the history and culture of the 
place through interactive means.
46
In addition to the benefit for rent accommodation, Gozitan 
students will be further supported thanks to the Villa Lauri 
accommodation project in Birkirkara. Work will also continue on 
the Dar Ġużeppi home for the elderly in Għajnsielem.
Against the background of Eco-Gozo, we will kick off the first 
phase of a pilot project for the generation of renewable energy 
from cow slurry and organic material.
We will continue working on the embellishment of a number 
of valleys; building of rubble walls; and afforestation in several 
areas.
3.20 Inter-island connectivity
Mr Speaker, the Government will keep striving to improve 
connectivity between our two islands.
Accordingly, the Fast Ferry transport project will be seen 
through, after ironing out the hitches that led to the introduction 
of this service being postponed. 
Through a call for offers for a Public Service Obligation we will 
be ensuring that the service of a fourth passenger ferry would 
be offered on a permanent basis. This is complemented by the 
introduction of the new bus service X300, which will be providing 
a quality service while responding to the needs of Gozitans who 
cross the channel on a daily basis. 
47
The pre-qualification questionnaire (PQQ) process for the 
tunnel project has now been completed. This is the first phase 
out of a three-phase process which should, subject to project 
feasibility, lead to the selection of the concessionaire for the 
design, construction, financing, operation and maintenance of 
the tunnel.
3.21 Agriculture and Fisheries 
The Government will continue to give due importance to the 
Agriculture and Fisheries sector.
Mr Speaker, next year we will be giving out grants equivalent to 
the tax paid on the sale of products by farmers and fishermen at 
the vegetable market (Pitkalija) and the fish market (Pixkerija).
These grants will be tied to investment in projects that reduce 
waste of agricultural and fisheries products. Systems that control 
the amount of a product that is placed on the market, based on 
customer demand, will be introduced.
Further details will be provided at a later stage.
This year we have provided assistance to foster a culture of 
training and innovation, to see that this sector grows in the 
same way as other sectors. Building on this, next year we will be 
offering new schemes with the objective of encouraging more 
young people into farming. At the same time we will continue 
with the various campaigns encouraging the consumption of 
local quality products.
48
The Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy will be implemented to 
improve biosecurity in farms and ensure the prudent use of 
antimicrobials.
We will continue our work on research centres in the fields of 
agriculture and aquaculture, and we will further improve the 
wine and viticulture research facilities at the National Centre 
for Wine and Vineyards. 
Next year we will start implementing the reform entailing the 
introduction of new traceability and modernisation systems in 
the structures of the Pitkalija vegetable market.
We will be facilitating investment at the Public Abattoir to 
enable by-products to be recovered and placed on the market. 
This would enhance the sector’s competitiveness while making 
available new specialised products.
In this budget we are voting funds for the launch of a scheme, 
based on a multiannual commitment, aimed at improving the 
welfare of pigs in farms. We will also be allocating funds for 
fishermen to continue restoring traditional wooden fishing boats 
built before 2007. Other funds will go towards the continuation 
of the metering process for boreholes to obtain a clear picture of 
groundwater consumption by the agricultural sector and ensure 
the sustainable use of this resource. 
We will be upgrading the quarantine facilities for small animals, 
with the aim of continuing to improve animal protection 
49
and welfare standards. Furthermore, work will begin on the 
construction of an animal cemetery.
3.22 Management and conservation of water
Water is an essential resource for our country, especially when 
considering our semi-arid climate and the ever-increasing 
demand. The Government will keep working on projects that 
safeguard this resource while ensuring that the best quality 
product is delivered to the consumer.
Extensive work is ongoing on five reservoirs in the southern 
part of Malta for the production of new water through a tertiary 
treatment process. Dispensers are being installed and the 
distribution network extended, so that more farmers, in both 
the northern and southern parts of the island as well as in Gozo, 
will be able to benefit from this project.
Works are set to continue on the reverse osmosis plant in Gozo 
and on the tunnel that will link the Pembroke reverse osmosis 
plant to the reservoirs at Ta’ Qali. At the same time, investment 
will be made in water production and distribution systems to 
meet the increased water demand. The programme of water 
pipe and mains replacement; investment in pumping stations; 
and expansion of the production capacity of reverse osmosis 
plants should lead to better tap water quality, less water wasted 
through leaks and greater efficiency, while safeguarding Malta’s 
groundwater resources. Work is also due to commence on 
the development of advanced monitoring systems for water 
resources in Malta.
50
The national campaign for water conservation will continue, and 
will include the distribution of water saving kits to residents; 
continuation of educational activities for schoolchildren at the 
National Water Conservation Awareness Centre; and educational 
projects for water conservation in schools.
In the coming year we expect to complete works on the 
development of the Sant’Antnin plant, while a new plan will be 
launched for the overhaul of the drainage system and sewage 
treatment plants over a number of years.
3.23 Mass transportation systems
The first phase of the study on the possibility of introducing 
a mass transportation system, consisting of an underground 
light-rail metropolitan system, has been completed. Next year 
the second phase of the study will be carried out, which will 
cover, among others, a detailed geotechnical investigation; 
seismic studies and utility service requirements. One would be 
in a position to decide whether the project is viable after these 
detailed studies are completed.
51
4. TOWARDS A GREEN ECONOMY 
Mr Speaker,
If one had to identify a positive effect of the COVID pandemic, it 
would be the improvement in air quality after emissions dropped 
by 40 per cent. Above all, people started to be more aware of the 
environment that surrounds them and the lack of open spaces in 
our localities. We all yearn for a better environment and quality 
of life. The environment is there to be enjoyed by our children, 
elderly persons, families, future generations.
While aiming to become a carbon-neutral country we are taking 
decisive steps, such that while our living standard continues to 
improve, we translate this wealth into a reduction in emissions 
– which in turn leads to a better quality of life.
Indeed, the Government will intensify its efforts to pursue a vision 
that integrates economic growth and environmental principles, 
and that aims for the country to become carbon-free by 2050.
In the coming months we will continue to revise the Strategic 
Plan for the Environment and Planning (SPED) and to work on 
the National Strategy for the Environment (NSE) 2050, updated 
and founded on the well-being concept, where the environmental 
dimension forms an integral part of the decisions taken by the 
country. We need to ensure that wealth generation and citizens’ 
well-being go hand in hand.
52
In the budget for next year the Government is directing funds 
towards this aim as well, and we expect to announce the first 
concrete initiatives in this regard over the coming months.
4.1 Climate change
Climate change is a challenge for us all. As a signatory to the 
Paris Agreement, our country has extremely ambitious goals. 
Reducing emissions is everyone’s responsibility. Accordingly, 
by the end of this year we will be finalising a strategy that will 
lead us to zero carbon (Low Carbon Development Strategy). 
Among other things, this strategy will be exploring avenues 
for cleaner energy, and will recommend actions for cleaner 
means of transport; high and efficient energy standards for 
buildings; as well as more holistic and environment-friendly 
waste management systems, among other areas.
More than ever before, the need is also felt that each and every 
person living in Malta and Gozo should understand the urgency 
of taking prompt action in the face of climate change, and more 
importantly the part that each and every person can play in 
overcoming this global challenge. Consequently, throughout 
the coming year we will be launching an educational campaign 
about climate change, what causes it, its consequences and the 
concrete ways in which everyone, through small changes, can 
make a difference.
4.2 Green Economy financing incentives 
Over the next year, the Malta Stock Exchange will be offering 
an attractive package for investors to issue “Green Bonds” to 
53
be used to finance projects that promote renewable energy and 
reduce air pollution.
4.3 Waste management 
Mr Speaker, in recent months we announced the largest ever 
investment in the waste management sector in our country, that 
is the construction of a Material Recovery Facility, which should 
place us in a better position to process recyclable waste in a way 
that a market for its recovery can be sourced. We are building a 
plant for the treatment of organic waste, from which we would 
not only recover renewable energy, but also produce compost 
that our farmers could use in their fields to improve soil quality. 
We will have a new plant, replacing the old one in Marsa, for the 
treatment of clinical and animal waste. Above all, we will continue 
our work to implement the Waste-to-Energy Facility project, 
involving the setting up of a plant that produces electrical energy 
from non-recyclable waste, which should drastically reduce the 
need to take up large tracts of land to turn into landfills.
By the end of this year we expect to publish the New Plan for 
Waste Management.
Producers also play a crucial role in our country’s waste 
management efforts. Over the coming period we plan to 
widen the scope of existing schemes, such as those relating to 
packaging waste and electronic equipment.
We will be working to address, for the first time ever, the 
separation of waste generated by the commercial sector.
54
Last September, a contract was signed between the Government 
and the private sector to introduce a refund system for beverage 
containers. The next step is that, over the coming year, the 
necessary infrastructure is put in place, including installation of 
the machines through which the general public will be able to 
return empty containers.
4.4 Single-Use Plastics
Next year we will also intensify our efforts to reduce the use of 
single-use plastics. An important step in this direction will be 
the ban on importation of single-use plastics with effect from 
1 January of next year. The following year, in 2022, the ban will 
extend to the sale of such products. In the meantime, the general 
public needs to become more aware of the damage that single-
use plastics cause in the natural environment.
4.5 Air quality and biodiversity
The air quality in our towns and villages should rightly be 
protected. Accordingly, next year a new air quality monitoring 
station in Xemxija will start operating, hence extending the 
existing monitoring range. A plan to improve the air quality in 
our country will also be drawn up.
Meanwhile, over the coming year work will continue on the 
formulation of the National Biodiversity Strategy 2022-2030, 
which will be updated in accordance with our obligations to 
ensure that our country’s rich biodiversity is protected in the 
best possible way.
55
The project for the construction of the Ta’ Qali National Park 
will be continued. This is the largest environmental project ever 
carried out in Malta and will turn out a large recreation space 
to be enjoyed by Maltese families all year round.
Throughout the forthcoming year we will continue making our 
urban zones greener – including village squares and open spaces 
to provide more areas of recreation for our families.
This year we will have installed the first four Green Walls in our 
country. Following on this, over the next year we will be launching 
schemes to enable private residences and commercial outlets in 
urban areas to install Green Walls on their facades.
Similarly, we will be working on environmental projects based on 
the grey to green concept, so we can enjoy green infrastructure 
in the areas we live and work in, including areas we pass through 
every day.
We have launched an initiative whereby a team of officials 
(“Rangers”) will be present in natural sites to help the general 
public to better understand the site’s characteristics and 
biodiversity. These rangers will now be explaining to people which 
activities can be carried out without damaging biodiversity, and 
how one can visit and enjoy the site while fully respecting the 
area’s environmental integrity.
In addition, we will continue investing to create a better 
environment for future generations through the embellishment 
56
of urban areas, where more trees will be planted and new 
afforestation areas created.
4.6 A new European system relating to toxic gas emissions
by vehicles 
Following the happenings in relation to vehicle testing for 
toxic gas emissions, the European Union has introduced a 
new test. This is the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test 
Procedure (WLTP), which will provide a more accurate basis for 
the calculation of a vehicle’s fuel consumption and level of gas 
emissions. For a particular vehicle, this test will show a higher 
value of gas emissions when compared to that shown by the 
previous test. Since the registration tax and annual road licence 
fees are linked to these emission indicators, the Government 
has thought fit to revise this link such that the amounts payable 
remain unchanged.
Mr Speaker, various studies have been undertaken to ensure that 
the consumer is not required to pay more than what is currently 
being paid, both with respect to registration tax as well as the 
annual road licence.
I am glad to announce that, although this revised testing system 
for new registrations will come into force as from 1 January of 
next year, the large majority of consumers will benefit from a 
reduction in their registration tax and road licence payments, 
whereas others will keep paying the amounts they are paying 
today. No one will be paying more than is currently the case. So 
much so that the Government is estimating that next year its 
income from these dues will drop by three million euro (€3m).
57
4.7 Incentives for renewable energy use
Over the coming year, Enemalta will keep enhancing its electricity 
distribution network and the service offered to the public. At the 
same time, the Government will keep stressing the importance 
of using energy that is diversified, efficient and clean, derived 
from renewable sources. 
Accordingly, we will be keeping in force various schemes that 
incentivise investment in renewable energy sources. These 
include schemes for the installation of solar photovoltaic panels; 
heat pump water heaters; solar water heaters and batteries for 
the storage of renewable energy. Furthermore, a feed-in tariff 
will continue to be established for electricity generated from 
solar photovoltaic installations.
The schemes for restoration of wells in residential households; 
for replacement of appliances for vulnerable families; and for a 
grant on the purchase of a reverse osmosis system; are likewise 
being extended.
In view of the need for more awareness of the advantages of 
batteries installed with photovoltaic systems, we are launching 
a pilot project whereby this technology, with batteries being 
used for the storage of renewable energy, will be installed in a 
public building. This will enable the benefits of this technology 
to be demonstrated in a practical way.
In addition, five “Eco-Intermodal Hubs” will be installed in 
strategic locations across Malta and Gozo, where the public will 
have access to all information about means of transport, rental 
58
of e-scooters and e-bikes, as well as mobile charging and WIFI 
facilities.
We will continue the installation of a mix of 130 medium-fast and 
fast-charging pillars for electric vehicles to be made available 
to the general public.
In 2021, the Government will undertake a study for the 
replacement of fuel-powered vehicles with electric cars in the 
public service.
The Government will continue to stimulate investment in research 
and innovation in the energy and water fields such that, through 
collaboration with the academia and industry, researchers would 
receive financial assistance to be able to work on projects for the 
development of products, technologies and solutions suitable 
for our country’s needs.
4.8 Grant for the scrappage of polluting cars
We will be allocating one and a half million euro (€1.5m) for 
vehicle scrappage schemes, with the grant value varying 
according to how environment-friendly the new vehicle is.
In terms of existing schemes, a grant will be given for the 
scrappage of vehicles that have been in circulation for more 
than ten years, when these are replaced by more environment-
friendly vehicles. The grant value will vary in accordance with the 
level and category of the car and will be subject to a maximum 
of seven thousand euro (€7,000).
59
Eligibility for these schemes is open to private individuals, private 
companies and non-governmental organisations registered as 
such.
4.9 Investment in alternative means of transport 
We will be extending for yet another year the measures related 
to the purchase of electric vehicles, with the aim of increasing 
the proportion of less-polluting vehicles.
Accordingly, we are keeping in force the measure relating to 
electric vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles, which will continue 
to be exempt from registration tax and also from the annual 
road licence fee for five years from the date of first registration.
The special rate applicable to residential households so that 
owners of electric vehicles can charge the battery overnight, 
will remain in force.
4.10 Other schemes
We are once again extending the scheme where a grant 
equivalent to a full VAT refund is given on the purchase of 
bicycles and electric bicycles. The same applies to the scheme 
that incentivises the purchase of motorcycles, scooters and 
bicycles equipped with an electric motor, subject to a maximum 
grant value of four hundred euro (€400).
For those who convert their vehicle to run on gas instead of 
petrol, the grant value is now being raised to four hundred euro 
60
(€400). However, in order to be eligible, the CO2 emissions of 
the vehicle in question will need to be reduced by 25 per cent.
This scheme is being extended to apply to all transport vehicles 
carrying passengers and cargo, where in this case the grant 
value will increase to a maximum of eight hundred euro (€800).
When due for annual renewal in the coming year, the circulation 
licence fee for motorcycles with a cubic capacity between 125cc 
and 250cc will decrease from €65 to €25 per annum.
4.11 Vehicles and motorcycles used only on weekends and
public/national holidays 
The owners of all vehicles, including motorcycles, already 
registered with the Transport Authority, will be able to apply 
for their vehicle to be licensed for use solely on weekends and 
public and national holidays. In such case, they stand to benefit 
from a reduction of thirty-five per cent in their annual circulation 
licence fee.
4.12 Grant for new taxis to be wheelchair-accessible 
The Government wishes to continue to ensure that persons 
with disability enjoy the same opportunities and thus integrate 
further within society.
Consequently, a budget allocation is being made for a number 
of new taxis to be eligible to a grant of ten thousand euro 
(€10,000) payable upon registration of a taxi vehicle that is 
accessible for wheelchairs (WAT). This grant applies only when 
61
another vehicle, with an internal combustion engine that is at 
least ten years from its date of manufacture and that has had a 
valid licence for the last five years, is registered and scrapped 
at an authorised facility.
62
5. STRENGTHENING THE INFRASTRUCTURE 
5.1 Continuation of arterial, residential and rural road
construction projects
As it has done in the past years, the Government will continue 
implementing its infrastructural plan to provide the Maltese 
islands with an arterial, residential and rural road network that 
is fit for a modern country. In this way Malta will keep enhancing 
its road infrastructure to be able to meet the island’s future 
transport needs.
Next year we will witness the completion of major projects, such 
as the Central Link Project and the new junction located between 
Pembroke and High Ridge in Swieqi. By way of new projects to 
be initiated, works are planned on the Kirkop tunnels and the 
Airport Intersection Project, the Luqa Junction Project and the 
Msida Creek Junction.
We will continue making the necessary preparations for the 
reconstruction of the Marsascala bypass and the construction 
of a new subway near Portes des Bombes.
Maintenance and upgrading work will be undertaken on various 
residential and rural roads, and renovation works are on the cards 
for the four main tunnels on the island, namely those of Santa 
Venera, Kirkop, Tal-Qroqq and Ta’ Giorni.
As part of our sustainable infrastructure plan, road projects 
will continue to feature the construction of wide pavements, 
63
bridges and lanes reserved for cyclists’ use. We are launching 
a pilot project – the Safe Cycle Routes Project – whereby safer 
routes for cyclists will be indicated and urban roads enhanced 
to facilitate cycling and walking.
5.2 Regeneration of the ports and improvement of
maritime sector facilities
Mr Speaker, we will be completing the work on five maritime 
projects, namely the new breakwater in Marsaxlokk; four quays 
at St Thomas Bay and in Marsascala; the reconstruction of the 
Ċirkewwa quay; and the facilities for fishermen at the Mġarr 
Port in Gozo.
A number of new projects are due to be kicked off next year, 
among which we can mention an upgrade of the infrastructure 
around the coast, including new facilities – in Sliema and 
Cospicua; Ta’ Xbiex, Buġibba and Vittoriosa – for passengers 
who use ferry boats as a means of transport. To complement 
these projects, existing quays will be repaired as necessary.
Final preparations will be underway leading to the eventual 
launch of the Grand Harbour Clean Air Project. This will provide 
the Grand Harbour with a shoreside electricity system which will 
cut down on air pollution caused by cruise liners.
5.3 Investing in the industrial infrastructure for tomorrow 
We will be embarking on an investment programme to a value 
of more than four hundred fifty million euro (€450m) over a 
span of seven years, which will change the face of our country’s 
64
industrial infrastructure while creating new spaces and offices 
for businesses.
This programme will comprise investment in the new Life 
Sciences Park; the Kordin Business Centre; the regeneration 
of an area in Marsa previously used for dumping of waste and 
which will now be used to create a new space for SMEs; as well 
as investment in a logistics centre. It is indeed an ambitious 
programme that marks a new chapter in the history of Maltese 
industry. 
The regeneration plan for the Ta’ Qali Crafts Village has 
reached an advanced stage. The Government is committed 
to the completion of this project by the end of next year, and 
accordingly a plan has been drawn up to give the necessary 
support to those businesses that have fallen behind on their 
construction project. In this way the upgrading of the Crafts 
Village will be completed at one go.
As part of the consolidation of our aviation infrastructure, the 
Lima taxiway reconstruction project is set to commence. This will 
complement present needs as well as Malta’s plans to become 
a centre for aviation maintenance.
5.4 Modernisation of health facilities 
The Government will keep strengthening the infrastructure of 
the facilities providing health services. Projects in this regard 
include the new Outpatients building and the underground car 
park at Mater Dei; further modernisation of the Mount Carmel 
Hospital wards; building of a new regional health centre in the 
65
northern part of Malta; the modernisation of the health centres, 
including the Gżira Health Centre; and the modernisation of the 
community clinics (bereġ) across Malta and Gozo; as well as the 
ongoing works on the new health centre in Rabat, Gozo.
The Government is also announcing that, thanks to European 
funding, it will be setting up a new blood bank, together with 
a specialised centre for processing and storage of tissue and 
stem cells. This centre will introduce new services, such as bone 
freezing and storage of corneas and stem cells for use by patients 
being treated at the Oncology Hospital.
5.5 Further infrastructural investment in tertiary
educational institutions and schools 
Mr Speaker, during the coming year we will be investing in a 
new sports complex at the University of Malta. This complex will 
comprise, among other things, facilities for the performing arts; 
an indoor track for athletes’ training; a full size football pitch; 
an Olympic track and a new building to house the Institute of 
Physical Education and the School of Performing Arts.
We will also carry on improving and building new facilities at 
MCAST, so that students, employees and the nearby community 
would have access to sports, recreational and educational 
facilities.
This year we have completed the new primary school in Qawra, 
executed another phase of the Żejtun secondary school project, 
and we will shortly complete the restoration of the School of Arts. 
Following on this, we will take on further development works 
66
for the construction of two new schools – the primary school in 
Rabat, Gozo and the one in Msida, as well as the extension and 
major modernisation works at the secondary school in Santa 
Lucia and the San Ġorġ primary school in Qormi. 
This investment in the educational infrastructure is required to 
secure a better educational future for our children.
5.6 Further investment in sports facilities 
As part of Malta’s preparations to host the Small Nations Games, 
which are being held here in 2023, we will continue not only to 
modernise but also to add various new sports facilities to address 
the needs of different sport disciplines. This will be done through 
an investment, over a span of three years, to the tune of eleven 
million euro (€11m).
These new facilities will include, among others, the building of 
an indoor rowing tank in Cottonera, which training facility would 
eventually be made available to all organisations practising this 
sport; and the building of an Outdoor Velodrome in Pembroke, 
which should attract international competitions to Malta.
We will also set the ball rolling for the construction of a Rugby 
Complex in Corradino.
5.7 Construction of Social Housing
The programme initiated a few years ago, entailing plans for 
the construction of 500 apartments through funding from 
the European Investment Bank and the Council of Europe 
67
Development Bank, as well as almost another 700 apartments 
with investment partly sourced from the National Development 
and Social Fund (NDSF), is proceeding at a fast pace and will 
be continued. 
At the same time, ongoing works will continue on the 
maintenance and embellishment programme for apartment 
blocks in Government Housing Estates. 
5.8 Enhancing the construction industry 
The Government will be effecting the changes needed in the 
building and construction sector, through the setting up of 
the Building and Construction Authority next year. This should 
lead to a higher level of professionalism in the way the industry 
operates; a lower risk of accidents on construction sites; and 
protection of the surrounding environment. 
The Authority will be responsible for issuing policies, regulations 
and standards for building and construction. An independent 
tribunal will also be set up to hear objections against any 
decisions taken.
Yet perhaps the most important measure will be the introduction 
of a Compensation Fund for the first time ever.
The enactment of a new law regulating real estate agents has 
continued to enhance this industry. Over recent months, training 
courses have started being delivered to a substantial number of 
individuals who operate as agents or property sale consultants. 
68
Consequently, for the first time in Malta, a licence will be required 
for one to be able to act as a real estate agent, property broker 
(sensar), or property consultant. 
5.9 Property regeneration
Having formulated a rigorous process, which is approved by the 
National Audit Office (NAO), various sites and public properties 
will now be evaluated. The aim is that, in collaboration with the 
private sector, these derelict and neglected sites are rehabilitated 
so they can continue making an active contribution to the 
country’s economic development.
In terms of another scheme to be introduced, individuals or 
companies will be given the opportunity to request an extension 
of the emphyteusis on commercial property to enable them to 
carry out investment on such property.
5.10 Restoration and regeneration of zones and sites
The regeneration work that we started in various areas in 
Marsamxett in Valletta will proceed, while the projects in 
Marsaxlokk and at the Mall Gardens in Floriana will be completed. 
Meanwhile, similar regeneration work is set to commence in 
Cottonera. The relative projects will include work in Senglea, 
Kalkara, Vittoriosa and the building of a new promenade in 
these areas. Work will also commence on the Msida and Pietà 
promenades.
69
Works are due to continue on the extension of the sandy beach 
at Għadira, as well as on the car parking areas in Għadira and 
Birżebbuġa.
Heritage Malta has assumed responsibility for the restoration 
and regeneration of the Grandmaster’s Palace in Valletta. This 
restoration is currently underway, and includes the replacement 
of all ceilings, as well as the restoration of all paintings and the 
relocation of the armoury to its original location.
In addition, work is set to commence on historical sites including 
the Cisterns and the Interpretation Centre, as well as the Main 
Guard building which is being restored and opened to the public.
At the Maritime Museum we will proceed with regeneration and 
restoration works which will also cover the naval ovens within 
the building. Thanks to this restoration, a new experience will 
be created spanning across the entire museum. 
Through the Cottonera Foundation, the extensive programme 
relating to restoration works on the Cottonera Lines, the Santa 
Margherita Lines and the Ricasoli Fort in Kalkara, among others, 
will be continued.
Similar restoration work will be done on the Victoria Lines in 
the Għargħur area; the Salib tal-Għolja Chapel; and the Jesuits’ 
Oratory and Church.
70
6. REACHING HIGHER LEVELS IN HEALTH AND
EDUCATION 
6.1 The COVID pandemic
Mr Speaker, 2020 will be remembered as the year in which the 
whole world faced an unprecedented challenge – the COVID-19 
pandemic.
The Government takes this opportunity to reiterate its 
appreciation for the dedication of all the workers who have been 
going out of their way to ensure that this pandemic is controlled, 
restrained and cured.
Thanks to the agreement entered into with European Union 
members and with the European Commission, the Government 
will be procuring the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as this is placed 
on the market, and hence safeguard the public health of all the 
people of Malta and Gozo.
The COVID-19 pandemic did not just make way for the creation 
of a ‘new normal’. More than that, it left an impact on demand 
for health services. It also created the need for new services, as 
well as the necessity to modify certain existing services. For this 
purpose, the Government has created the so-called Pandemic 
Reserve, which will provide additional resources to enable the 
country to keep countering the spread of the COVID-19 virus in 
an effective manner.
71
In this context, and in the light of the restructuring necessitated 
at Mater Dei due to the circumstances precipitated by COVID-19, 
financial resources are being allocated, including for the 
purposes of renting additional facilities, so that acute care and 
scheduled elective care can still continue to be provided without 
constraints, albeit from new facilities.
6.2 Medicines and new services 
Besides addressing the immediate needs that arose from 
the pandemic, the Government anticipated the impact that 
the pandemic would have on the management of other 
chronic diseases. Accordingly, we will continue upholding our 
commitment to provide free medicines as well as to introduce 
new medicinal products targeted mainly at the needs of persons 
suffering from chronic diseases.
Along with the investment made over the past years, we will 
now also introduce the treatment of osteoporosis to address 
the needs of patients, especially elderly vulnerable persons, who 
typically experience a low quality of life due to this condition.
Mr Speaker, in line with our commitment towards the execution 
of the Mental Health Strategy 2020-2030, we will introduce new 
psychiatric drugs on the Government Formulary, complementing 
the range of mental health services offered in the community, 
and invest in the planned new hospital for acute psychiatric care 
close to Mater Dei Hospital.
Acknowledging the fact that a number of cancer patients 
require specific oncological drugs and treatments abroad, 
72
the Government plans to increase investment in more holistic 
cancer care. To this end, we will be opening Ċentru San Mikiel, a 
facility providing professional palliative care. This project will be 
implemented thanks to a partnership between the Government 
and Hospice Malta and will be aligned to the National Palliative 
Care Strategy.
We are also committed to broaden the Survivorship Programme 
service, which supports relatives and patients who have managed 
to overcome cancer.
Over the coming year, we will update Mater Dei Hospital’s 
network infrastructure; extend the Remote Patient Monitoring 
programme to reach a number of chronic disease patients; 
and introduce new systems for Clinic Management and for 
the Telemedicine Client Support Centre, which will facilitate 
communication between doctor and patient from the comfort 
of their respective homes.
Mr Speaker, we are aware of the fact that education is one of 
the main pillars for the prevention of disease. In addition to the 
launch in 2021 of the Strategy for the Elimination of Hepatitis C, 
we are set to continue with the educational campaign to increase 
awareness about sexual health, sexually-transmitted diseases, 
and the importance of getting tested more regularly. 
We will also continue running an ambitious educational 
programme focusing primarily on the improvement of employees’ 
health at the workplace, as well as a campaign about eating 
disorders and obesity in children and young people in Malta.
73
The Government considers the training of its professionals to be 
crucial for enhancing public health in our country. Accordingly, 
we will invest in training for health sector employees, while 
incentivising healthcare professionals to undertake training in the 
field of prevention. This is essential so we can keep building on 
the success already achieved in our drive to provide the highest 
quality services and guarantee continuous improvement in the 
health of Maltese and Gozitan people. 
6.3 Care of the elderly
We are aware that the number of elderly persons needing 
gerontological care is increasing, and that, thanks to the high 
level of our quality of life as well as the health services we enjoy, 
Maltese people are living a longer life. In view of this, Government 
is engaging in long-term planning to keep pace with these trends 
and accordingly increase the number of beds for the elderly. 
This will be done by ensuring that more beds are available for 
elderly persons, both in public hospitals as well as in projects 
run together with the private sector, or through the acquisition 
of beds from private operators.
Having said that, the Government’s main objective is that the 
elderly keep living in the community while remaining active. We 
are thus increasing the number of Active Ageing day centres 
and night shelters, some of which will be focusing on specific 
conditions, for dementia sufferers and for persons with disability.
We are also enhancing the Home Help and Telecare services and 
extending the range of services provided in towns and villages, 
74
such as the Silver T and the phlebotomy services. We will also 
see that the KartAnzjan is given a new lease of life.
With regard to standards, we are not only launching Social 
Regulatory Standards for care services for older persons, but 
we are also bolstering specialised training in elderly care for 
persons wishing to work in this field.
6.4 Holistic education 
The Government is committed to continue providing learning 
opportunities to ensure that all children, young people and adults 
can obtain the necessary skills to succeed at work and in society. 
This is being done within a strategy framework for our 
educational system, designed to continue gradually reducing the 
rate of early school leavers; to increase the proportion of adults 
aged between 30 and 34 years with tertiary level qualifications; 
and to foster more participation in adult learning.
On top of this, the closure of schools and educational institutions 
due to the pandemic has shown us the importance of internet 
and online access for each and every student. Accordingly, 
we will be giving free internet access, for a whole year, to all 
the students who choose to keep studying after completing 
their secondary schooling. We will also see that the National 
Commission for Further and Higher Education regularises the 
provision of online education.
75
In order to continue enhancing our children’s educational 
experience, we will also be offering online sessions for parents, 
so that these, together with teachers, would be able to contribute 
to the provision of higher quality education to their children.
The extensive online learning service, which includes accredited 
courses of the highest level, will be offered to adults and workers 
so that these can keep enhancing their skills and consequently 
improve and advance in their career. 
As part of the National Literacy Strategy for All, we will be 
ensuring that the Reading Recovery programme, an early 
intervention programme aimed at children in their first years 
within the educational system, reaches more students.
The Government will continue ensuring that each and every 
student receives the necessary attention to address his/her 
particular needs. Consequently, it will be investing to introduce 
Autism Units in our middle secondary schools. This involves 
having a dedicated classroom furnished with special equipment 
to address the needs of students with autism.
With a view to reducing stress for students, especially during 
exams, a pilot project will be undertaken, whereby students will 
sit for their SEC examinations at the school they presently attend.
6.5 A National Youth Policy 
With regards to young people, it is pertinent to mention that 
there is an  ongoing public consultation on a National Youth 
76
Policy for 2021-2030 titled Towards 2030 - Reaching out to, 
working with, and supporting young people, which will be 
focusing on all young persons between the ages of 13 and 30.
Towards 2030 will complement the national policy in related 
areas such as education, employment, justice and health – all 
of which have a bearing on young people.
We will ensure that all people, groups and organisations who 
work for and with young people are given the opportunity to 
actively participate and contribute to the development and 
implementation of this youth policy.
6.6 The voluntary sector
The Government is aware that voluntary organisations make 
an important contribution to society. Therefore as from next 
year, voluntary organisations that are enrolled as such and that 
are compliant with the provisions of the law regulating such 
organisations, will be exempted from tax on any profit they 
make throughout the year, as long as their annual income does 
not exceed fifty thousand euro (€50,000).
At the same time, we will ensure that voluntary organisations are 
transparent with regard to the donations they receive and how 
they spend them. We want to make sure that these organisations 
uphold the level of trust that the Maltese and Gozitan public 
puts in them.
77
6.7 Regulatory authorities for sports 
We will ensure that there is fair play in each and every competitive 
sport and we will continue striving to curb sports corruption. To 
this end, the Government will be setting up the Maltese Sports 
Integrity Authority, so that responsibility for overseeing this 
negative aspect of the sports sector will be in the hands of a 
sole entity.
With regard to the regulatory and organisational aspect of the 
conduct of horse races, the new Act for EquestriMalta will be 
coming into force, which Act will be establishing a new authority 
to replace the Malta Racing Club.
6.8 National heritage and culture
Our country’s history and heritage are the fundamental 
elements which form the identity of our people. Accordingly, 
the preservation of our historical legacy remains at the forefront 
of this Government’s agenda.  We will thus be investing further 
in the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage through more 
excavations of archaeological sites. 
In the cultural and creative sectors, the Government will be 
breathing new life into individual artists, cultural operators, and 
operators offering ancillary services in this sector, all of whom 
have suffered so much during the past months, so that they 
will be able to organise quality productions, shows, concerts or 
similar initiatives.
78
The application of digital technology is becoming an integral part 
in the production of artistic and cultural works, and thus we will 
see how we can help to encourage a stronger interdisciplinary 
element between technology, research and art.
During 2021, we will be organising a National Symposium for 
Culture and Creativity while continuing to invest in the Centre 
for Creativity Foundation.
We need to continue investing in the Maltese language to keep it 
alive. Accordingly, we will carry on working on the spell-checking 
digital resource for the Maltese language.
We will continue to invest in the restoration of Manoel Theatre 
and remain committed to see the Carnival Experience project 
being executed.
Next year we will keep exploring and opening underwater sites, 
thereby attracting more tourists and professional divers to our 
country. 
6.9 Local Councils
Mr Speaker, the investment that the Government has been 
directly making in local governments year after year is a clear 
sign of its strong belief in these key pillars of our country’s 
democratic structures. We believe that our investment in Local 
Governments translates into an improvement in the quality of 
life we all enjoy in our respective communities.
79
Throughout 2021 we will be investing to strengthen the structures 
of Regional Councils, such that, apart from fulfilling their 
functions with greater efficiency and effectiveness, they would 
be able to provide assistance to the Local Councils within their 
remit, including in the form of support by professional officers.
Upon the recommendations of the NAO report, an ICT Strategy 
for Local Government will be launched in a holistic way.
80
7. GOVERNANCE AND SECURITY
7.1 Further reforms for the strengthening of governance 
Good governance and the rule of law will remain a priority, 
and the necessary reforms will continue to be made to ensure 
national stability, trust in the institutions and economic growth. 
For this purpose, we have set up the Cabinet Committee on 
Governance, tasked with ensuring that Malta complies with 
the recommendations on good governance and rule of law put 
forward by the Venice Commission, GRECO and Moneyval.
Having introduced a legislative package based on the Venice 
Commission’s Opinion, discussions will continue at the 
Constitutional Convention being led by the President of the 
Republic.
We will keep strengthening the institutions with the help 
of experts from the World Bank, leading to the further 
strengthening of the Office of the Attorney General and the 
Office of the State Advocate. This phase of the reform includes 
the design of internal structures, administrative procedures and 
the organisation of the Attorney General’s Office and the State 
Advocate’s Office, to ensure that they operate efficiently and 
transparently while safeguarding the rule of law in our country, 
and also to align the internal structures and processes of these 
Offices to the level of professionalism required both locally and 
at international level. 
The Moneyval report has shown that more work is needed in 
relation to Malta’s legislative and technical tools, in order to 
81
introduce more awareness about the risks of money laundering 
as well as a suitable framework to combat financial crime.
Further to the Moneyval report issued in July 2019, the National 
Coordinating Committee on Combating Money Laundering and 
Funding of Terrorism (NCC) has been working hard to see that 
the competent authorities address all the recommendations. 
This work has led to significant results. With regard to 
cooperation between authorities, forty-four (44) Memoranda 
of Understanding have been drawn up.
Malta presented its report to Moneyval on 5 October. The report 
shows how Malta has addressed each of the fifty-eight (58) 
recommendations emanating from Moneyval’s original report, 
insofar as the legal and technical areas are concerned. 
We are satisfied that the Maltese institutions now have a good 
understanding of the risks of money laundering and funding of 
terrorism. The institutions, both in the public and private sectors, 
are prepared to effectively combat the risks which are always 
evolving and changing over time. In this way we expect to see 
effectiveness in the actions of our institutions and competent 
authorities.
Efficiency in the judicial procedure will remain a priority. In this 
regard, the Court Services Agency will do its utmost to offer 
the best possible support to members of the judiciary as well 
as an efficient and effective service to citizens who resort to 
court services. This will be done through investment in digital 
technology; an additional number of offices; and assumption of 
82
responsibility for the European Criminal Records Information 
System (ECRIS) as well as for the European Criminal Records 
Information System – Third Country Nationals (ECRIS-TCN). As 
a result, the police force will be able to focus more on criminal 
investigations and law enforcement.
In the judiciary field, a proposal will be put forward for the 
extension of the retirement age for judges and magistrates, while 
new appointments will be made on the judges’ bench.
In order to reduce the pending workload of the Court of Appeal, 
it will be given the opportunity to hold sittings only for the cases 
it deems necessary. There will also be the possibility for sittings in 
civil proceedings to be held through live video conferencing; and 
there will be an increase in the compositions of the (Superior) 
Courts of Civil Appeal so as to facilitate the appeals process and 
serve the citizen better and within a reasonable time.
We are launching a research project about domestic violence 
with the aim of improving and facilitating the service offered to 
the vulnerable victims of domestic violence, whilst improving 
the overall efficiency of the justice system in this sphere of 
operation. We will also be launching a training programme for 
professionals working in this field.
We will keep investing in the Asset Recovery Bureau by means of 
new technologies for the exchange, management and retrieval of 
information. We will also continue with another ambitious project 
relating to the construction of a specialised building, equipped 
with the latest technology, to host an asset tracing laboratory 
83
and an adequate space for the preservation of confiscated 
assets. The purpose of this building is to preserve and protect 
confiscated assets prior to their disposal, and to ensure that 
their value is transferred to the Government.
We will also be launching a modernisation project for the Office 
of the Notary to Government and the Main Archive, which 
among others will include the continuation of the notarial acts 
digitalisation process; ascertaining that all public deeds and wills 
are registered at the public registry in time; and ensuring that all 
the relevant taxes collected by notaries are paid in an effective 
manner to the relevant entities.
7.2 The Disciplined Forces
2021 will be the first full year during which the police force will 
be shaping its operations in accordance with its transformation 
strategy, which comprises forty-nine (49) concrete actions with 
the aim of transforming the police force into a police service. The 
Government is supporting this strategy including by providing 
the necessary resources.
Since the community is at the heart of an efficient and effective 
police force, next year we will continue to widen the scope of 
the community policing project. In its next phase this project 
will now need to start addressing also the more challenging 
localities such as Marsa, Ħamrun, St Paul’s Bay and St Julians 
to see to the enforcement of various laws.
Whereas the Government’s vision is to have a greater police 
presence in our streets, this does not detract from the need to 
84
invest in police stations considered as key, as we have indeed 
done this year.
This investment will continue with the completion of the new 
police station in Marsascala and the commencement of work on 
other police stations, particularly those at Msida and Ħamrun.
We also plan to complete the Command and Control Room at 
the Police General Headquarters and the modernisation of the 
forensic section.
In view of the increase in the prison population, further 
infrastructural investment will be carried out to make better 
and more effective use of the space at the correctional facilities.
New vehicles will be acquired to ensure that prisoners are 
escorted to court in a more secure manner, including for the 
correctional facility officials themselves. At the same time the 
prison’s CCTV system will be enhanced.
The psychology section will be reinforced and a programme for 
young offenders will be run. Meanwhile, the Agency for Crime 
Victims will start operating with the aim of bringing together 
several crime victim services under one roof while introducing 
new ones.
Likewise, at the Armed Forces of Malta further investment will 
be made so that soldiers would be better equipped to carry 
out their work. The Special Operations Unit will be bolstered 
85
and further improvements will be made to the communications 
systems. Works will continue at the different bases of the Armed 
Forces, including at the new operational centre in Luqa which 
is also anti-seismic.
The members of all the disciplined forces will, over the coming 
year, continue to be provided with training, both in Malta and 
abroad. The Academy for Disciplined Forces will carry on with 
the process of accreditation of its courses by the National 
Commission for Further and Higher Education (NCFHE), with 
the first accredited course being the one for basic training of 
police force recruits.
With regard to protection of our country’s critical infrastructure, 
next year we will be inaugurating a Security Monitoring Centre 
equipped with the most advanced technology. This centre, which 
will be running on a 24-hour basis, will be operating a monitoring 
network covering the country’s critical infrastructure, operators 
of essential services, and sensitive infrastructure.
7.3 Strengthening civil protection 
In accordance with its seven-year plan, next year the Civil 
Protection Department will carry on replacing its oldest vehicles 
with new ones. It will be acquiring specialised vehicles which 
would be sent out depending on the nature of the accident, 
ensuring short response times and better overall efficiency.
Investment in the maritime field will be continued with the 
expected arrival of the Department’s first fire boat, having 
86
the capability of extinguishing fires and carrying out rescue 
operations at sea even in extremely bad weather conditions.
Infrastructure development at the existing fire stations will be 
carried out, and work on the Santa Venera fire station is set to 
be continued.
7.4 Immigration
The reality of irregular immigration continues to necessitate a 
strong and realistic reaction by the Maltese authorities, with a 
view to easing, as much as possible, the burden carried by Malta 
as a country lying on the border of the European Union.
The main priority remains the prevention of arrivals and the 
fight against the criminals who put so many lives in danger. 
In this regard, we will carry on with our diplomatic efforts and 
collaboration with Libya with the aim of curtailing arrivals as 
much as possible.
The second priority is the return of migrants who do not deserve 
asylum in our country. The return of failed asylum seekers is a 
challenge for every European Union country and accordingly 
we will be taking a number of unprecedented initiatives.  We 
will be strengthening the International Protection Agency set up 
in recent months; reinforcing the Police’s Immigration Division; 
and setting up a new unit dedicated specifically to the return 
of such persons.
87
Last but not least, Malta will keep doing its utmost on the 
international level so that the immigration burden continues 
to be shared. This will be done through more initiatives to 
relocate immigrants in other European Union countries as well 
as resettlement programmes.
7.5 Equality and reforms 
It is acknowledged that achieving a better balance between one’s 
work and private life is of strategic and significant importance, 
for employers and employees alike.
Accordingly, we will be working to incentivise employers to offer 
measures leading to a better work-life balance and to encourage 
men to participate more in home life, thereby strengthening 
gender equality.
We will continue our fight against human trafficking through 
the setting up of the Human Rights and Equality Commission; 
we will start implementing the Gender Equality Strategy; we will 
seek to introduce the first National Action Plan against Racism 
and Xenophobia; and we will carry on working on other reforms 
including the one on cannabis. In addition, we will be introducing 
all the necessary reforms to ensure equal representation in 
Parliament.
A new centre for the LGBTIQ community will be set up, with 
the objective of bringing together, under one roof, a number 
of services and facilities provided by the Government and the 
Civil Society to the LGBTIQ community. This centre will also be 
88
providing financial support to the LGBTIQ community in bringing 
EuroPride 2023 to Malta.
7.6 Citizenship
The Government will ensure that measures are in place to provide 
full protection of individual identity. For this reason, the new 
identity cards will be equipped with the latest technology to 
make it much more difficult for this personal document to be 
falsified or stolen. 
We are cooperating with other European countries to make our 
borders more secure against the challenges of organised crime 
and the threat of terrorist attacks. This measure is termed smart 
borders.
In this regard, a computer system is being developed to maintain 
a record of each and every person who enters or exits the 
country. Further investment will be made so that more services 
are offered online, while an evaluation will be carried out on 
how the use of digital identity can be strengthened to facilitate 
the transfer of information which citizens need to obtain from 
the public sector. 
The Government has always embraced the principle that 
employees’ interests should be protected and that no abuse 
should take place at the workplace. For this purpose, more 
workplace inspections will be carried out to curb abuse and 
exploitation of persons at the workplace, while preventing human 
trafficking and forced labour.
89
As regards the Residence and Citizenship by Investment 
programmes, we are working to review, update and introduce 
more rigorous criteria to continue ensuring that individuals 
who are accepted under these schemes are fit to be granted 
citizenship or residence status in our country.
Further details about these criteria will be given once the new 
programmes are launched.
7.7 Collaboration beyond our shores
In the Foreign Affairs field, the Government is working 
relentlessly for peace and security in the Mediterranean region 
so that each nation can live free from the hardships brought 
about by conflicts. We do this through each forum in which we 
participate on a consistent basis. With regards to the Libya issue, 
we are doing our utmost to see that Libya is led by Libyans and 
we are making our full contribution to the development of the 
civil authorities and the economic recovery of this neighbour 
country, with a view to finding a political solution to this conflict.
Throughout this year we continued to ensure that we keep an 
open dialogue with all countries, giving particular attention to 
the Mediterranean and Africa. Having launched our strategy for 
Africa, we are seeking to keep consolidating our presence in this 
continent brimming with opportunities. In the European arena, 
we are seeking to find a common method to work together with 
other member states towards new solutions for problems we’ve 
had for years.
90
We will continue with our upgrade and renewal programme in 
relation to our embassies and consulates around the world. In 
addition to renovation of the premises, we will be introducing 
a number of adequate security measures while enhancing the 
work environment.
We will be scouting for suitable locations in Ethiopia and Latin 
America to serve as new embassies for Malta.
7.8 Malta’s campaign bid for the United Nations Security
Council
As already announced, Malta has presented its campaign bid 
for a non-permanent seat – reserved for the member countries 
of the Western European and Others Group – on the Security 
Council for a term of two years between 2023 and 2024.
Malta needs to secure the vote of two-thirds of the members of 
the United Nations at the election scheduled to take place in June 
2022 at the New York General Assembly. In view of this, during 
2021 Malta will continue to hold meetings with members of the 
United Nations to demonstrate the highly relevant credentials 
that Malta has to offer as a member of the United Nations 
Security Council.
91
8. CONCLUSION
Mr Speaker, I am proud to have presented this ninth budget 
today.
A budget that is the best and the largest I have ever presented.
A budget that will confirm that this movement really believes in 
the people of Malta and Gozo.
A budget that will show how we are ready to invest hundreds of 
millions of euro so that the economic engine we have built not 
only recovers but reaches levels never seen before.
A budget thanks to which we, as MALTESE people, will all be 
STRONG together and move FORWARD.
