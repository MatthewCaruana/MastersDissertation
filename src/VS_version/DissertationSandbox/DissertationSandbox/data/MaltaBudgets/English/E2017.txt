INTRODUCTION – GOVERNMENT’S VISION FOR MALTA 
 
Mr Speaker, I am presenting this budget with a greater sense of 
serenity than ever before because I am confident that now Maltese 
and Gozitan families have well understood Government's plan for 
this legislature and are feeling the positive effects of this plan in 
their pockets. 
 
Moreover, they are also acknowledging that all that Government 
undertook thus far was aimed, one step at a time, to reach those 
targets promised to families and businesses in the Electoral 
Programme.  And that aim was to create prosperity which 
generates jobs, new opportunities, and above all, the means to 
distribute this wealth more equitably to include  those most in 
need.  
 
Today we have reached a point where our economic and financial 
results, which are the envy of our partners in the European Union, 
are being taken for granted by some in our own country.  This 
gives us satisfaction because it means that our families are no 
longer plagued by the uncertainty that prevailed previously. It 
means that our families are today looking at important aspects of 
life such as the environment and the education of their children. 
They are no longer worried about whether they can even afford to 
pay their electricity bill.  
 
 
3 
 
This is evident from public opinion surveys. The Eurobarometer, 
carried out by the European Commission twice a year amongst 
families in our country, in 2012 showed that for 61 per cent of 
respondents, the issue of greatest concern was inflation.  Today 
this has gone down to 24 per cent, and now people are more 
concerned by immigration and environmental issues, amongst 
other things. 
  
This did not happen in neighbouring countries. Across the EU, 
almost half of those participating in the Eurobarometer are still 
seeing unemployment as the biggest problem in their country.  In 
our country, only five per cent are of the same opinion. In relative 
terms, ten times less.  
 
And this with good reason, because whilst in other countries 
unemployment is still a huge problem, especially for millions of 
young people, our country witnessed three consecutive years 
during which there was a surplus of jobs, such that foreigners had 
to be employed to sustain the economic rhythm. 
 
I would like to remind those who take these results for granted of 
our point of departure. 
 
When I was appointed Finance Minister, Government was faced 
with a deficit far in excess of that forecasted. Consequently, our 
country re-entered into the excessive deficit procedure by the 
European Commission. This was the third time in the space of ten 
4 
 
years.  Those who claim that the economic situation in our country 
was good, should be reminded that the country had just entered 
into the macro imbalances procedure where the Commission 
warned us about the high level of debt, not only public but also 
private debt.  Today, all this is history because our country exited 
both procedures with honours.  
 
Shortly before the start of this legislature, in January 2013, S&P 
Global Ratings had downgraded the country’s rating for the 
second time in that legislature. I am pleased to say that last 
Friday, we witnessed, for the first time in twenty years, a country 
upgrade for Malta from 'BBB+' to 'A-' by this agency. 
 
This came about because, in one budget after another, we were 
prudent and diligent in the execution of our plan.  In our first 
budget, the emphasis was on bringing back stability and certainty 
in our economy.  We presented our targets and took the 
necessary steps to build a dynamic economy, where businesses 
felt confident enough to invest and create jobs while our families 
had fewer burdens to carry, leaving them with a bigger spending 
power and an eagerness to look forward to new opportunities.  
 
In our second budget we rewarded diligence. We took the 
necessary steps to encourage and assist all those who wanted to 
work.  We reduced income tax and introduced tax credits and 
benefits to incentivise more people to enter the workforce.  We 
launched free childcare - a measure that many European 
5 
 
countries only dream of ever adopting.  We delivered our promise 
to reduce utility bills and to invest heavily in the energy sector after 
many long years of apathy. 
 
In the subsequent budget, we implemented progressive reforms in 
the social benefits system.  Whilst targeting abuse, we introduced 
clear incentives for whoever wanted to walk out of social 
dependence. It was not an easy decision.  We were criticised by 
some for opting to still pay a portion of social benefits to those who 
found employment.   
 
Today I am pleased to say that these measures were a sensible 
investment.  Thousands of persons benefited as they were able to 
come out of dependence on social assistance. They are now 
gainfully employed and are building a better life for themselves.  
 
Taxpayers benefited as millions of euro were saved in recurrent 
expenditure. In the past two years, expenditure on non-
contributory assistance was on a downward trend. These 
measures also benefited those who took advantage of these 
schemes and started working for their own improvement and for 
that of their families.   These successes in the labour sector and in 
economic performance, have led to an increase in Government 
revenue from taxation.  
 
 
6 
 
This, despite the fact that, since I have been Minister of Finance, I 
have had the pleasure of announcing consistent income tax cuts. 
Tax cuts, which had a favourable effect on all. 
 
In the budget for the current year, we made provision for those 
who had not yet directly benefited from measures taken in the 
preceding years. We reduced tax for lower income earners. We 
introduced tax credits for anyone who voluntarily invested in 
private pensions.  We yet again raised the in-work benefit for 
workers with a lower than average income. We continued to assist 
first time property buyers - the dowry of the Labour Government to 
young couples.  
 
And for the first time in a generation, we raised pensions by more 
than the cost of living adjustment.  A measure that benefited 
12,000 pensioners with the lowest income, whilst surviving 
spouses who had paid national insurance contributions were given 
the right to a much better pension.  
 
We could do this because Malta became a strong economy. 
 
What gives us most satisfaction is that this economic growth was 
accompanied by a strong upsurge in employment.  In many 
countries, despite the fact that national wealth was once again 
gaining rhythm, the increase in employment figures was little to 
none. During the same period, our national wealth increased by 15 
per cent whilst employment increased by 13 per cent.  
7 
 
 
The national wealth of our country is being felt by our families. In 
the first half of 2016,  €443 million more were paid out in wages 
and salaries, which is equivalent to an increase of 28 per cent, 
when compared to  the first half of the final year of the previous 
administration. Deposits of Maltese and Gozitan families in local 
banks today total €10.3 billion, an increase of 33 per cent over the 
amount at the start of this legislature. 
 
The budget for next year will continue to reinforce these results. 
 
We shall continue to strengthen our economy and give even more 
incentives to encourage more people to join the labour force and 
our young people to acquire the necessary skills to fully benefit 
from our strong economy. Although significant progress was 
registered in this sector, we feel we can achieve even better 
results because the potential exists.  
 
Our ambition is to achieve that which was acquired by Northern 
European countries years ago, where the rate of employment 
exceeds 70 per cent. Moreover, in the same way we have strived 
to encourage more people to go out to work, we must now take up 
the challenge of giving our work force the necessary skills. This 
will mean more investment in education, both academic and 
vocational, even more so in the latter.  Employers are facing too 
many challenges in finding workers with the necessary skills.  In 
the coming years we shall be addressing this issue.  
8 
 
At the same time we shall continue improving access to adequate 
financing for businesses. 
 
We shall continue with unprecedented investment in our economy.  
Last year we had an absolute record in the history of our country 
in capital expenditure. We succeeded in taking up a very large 
amount of European funds to improve our infrastructure.  And we 
shall press on in this direction.  As the private sector grows and 
attracts more investment, it is the duty of the Government to bring 
about an improvement in the country's infrastructure, be it in 
energy, transport, health and education. And this, in collaboration 
with the private sector. 
 
Above all however, this budget is a social budget. Hence the 
message:  Malta - Prosperity that reaches everyone.  
 
Because we are aware that, although many are benefiting from the 
progress we have made, there are still others who are finding it 
hard to make ends meet.  Through the strength we have acquired 
and the wealth we have created, we are now in a position to help 
these people with a greater sense of purpose than ever before.  
 
In this budget will shall continue in this direction, assisting our 
families in facing new challenges, such as the increase in house 
rents. And we shall continue to assist those who voluntarily wish to 
save for their retirement.  
 
9 
 
At the same time, we have taken steps to assist those who cannot 
join the workforce and more measures will be introduced through 
this budget to improve their income.  And because we have a 
strong economy, we can provide all this without negatively 
impacting the deficit. 
 
In truth, we are building a Malta where prosperity reaches 
everyone.  
 
The Economic and Financial Situation 
 
Mr Speaker, at this point I would like to take a look at the latest 
economic and financial developments in Malta, as well as the 
outlook for the coming years, particularly because the budget is 
built on these figures. 
 
With great satisfaction, I can affirm that in the first half of the 
current year Malta registered an economic growth of 4.1 per cent 
in real terms and 6.1 per cent in nominal terms.   By way of 
comparison, our growth in real terms was more than double the 
growth registered in the European Union and in the Euro Zone, 
where the average economic growth in the first half of 2016 was of 
1.9 per cent.  
 
This growth was supported by strong increases in private 
consumption and investment, which reflected the increases in 
wages and salaries, as well as higher corporate profits. It is also 
10 
 
important to note that growth was diversified as the majority of 
sectors, including manufacturing, recorded an increase in Gross 
Value Added.  
 
In employment, today we have reached a stage where, in general, 
one no longer seeks work but rather seeks to improve one’s job 
position. According to Eurostat, employers in our country have a 
job vacancy rate that is almost double the European average.  
Malta is attracting foreign workers because it has jobs to offer.  
 
This massive growth in employment was generated by the private 
sector which continued to be the major source for job creation. In 
April of this year, the total increase in jobs was of almost 7,400 
where more than 7,000 of these were created by the private 
sector. This means that 96 per cent of all new jobs were in the 
private sector.  The sectors that created most jobs included 
professional, technical, scientific and administrative services, as 
well as the arts, entertainment and recreation.  
 
Also to be noted is the substantial rise in female employment.  
During the three years of this legislature, the rate of female 
employment rose by almost 6 percentage points. 
 
Another success story was the decrease in unemployment, 
particularly 
among 
young 
people. 
In 
fact, 
the 
rate 
of 
unemployment reached a record low level of 4.9 per cent in July of 
this year, whilst youth unemployment amounted to 10.8 per cent. 
11 
 
The number of young people registering for work went down from 
1,250 to a mere 326. 
 
This was happening at a time when inflation remained relatively 
low at 1 per cent according to the Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices (HICP), and 0.82 per cent according to the Retail Price 
Index (RPI), in August of this year.  
 
Success was also achieved in international trade, where in the first 
seven months of this year, exports net of fuels went up by €454 
million, compared to the same period last year. Substantial growth 
was also registered in the export of services, including tourism, 
where in the first seven months of this year, and excluding cruise 
passengers, Malta hosted around 1.1 million tourists.  This is 
equivalent to a growth of 10 per cent when compared to the same 
period in 2015.  
 
This led to a growth in tourist spending of 5.4 per cent whilst the 
number of nights spent in Malta rose by 7.3 per cent. 
 
These positive results had a favourable impact on the Global 
Competitiveness Report issued by the international World 
Economic Forum.  According to the latest edition of the Global 
Competitiveness Index (2016-2017), Malta advanced by no less 
than eight places on the basis of substantial growth and 
sustainable public finances. Out of 138 countries around the world, 
Malta has now risen to 40th place.  
12 
 
Let's move on to public finances. 
 
The immediate improvements obtained in this sector carried 
forward into this year.  This year, we are expecting the deficit in 
public finances to decrease to 0.7 per cent which is 0.4 lower than 
the original budgetary estimate and an improvement of 0.7 
percentage points over last year.  Our target of a favourable fiscal 
balance is, so to say, right round the corner. 
 
An integral indicator on the state of public finances is public debt 
as compared to the Gross Domestic Product, or better put, in 
relative terms. This gives us a clearer indication of the burden of 
public debt on the economy.  At the end of 2013, public debt fell to 
68.6 per cent; at the end of 2014 it decreased to 67.1 per cent 
whilst at the end of 2015 it had gone down to 64 per cent. This 
year we anticipate that public debt will continue to fall to 63.3 per 
cent of Gross Domestic Product. This means that families in Malta 
and Gozo, who in their large majority are averse to any form of 
debt, are now seeing that each year we are achieving all of our 
forecasts and estimates.  
 
All this was achieved while financing the ever growing needs of 
health, education and social security.  
 
 
 
 
 
13 
 
Forecasts for the Economy and Public Finances 
 
Before moving on to local economic forecasts I would like to take a 
look at international economic forecasts for the coming years.  The 
most recent forecast issued by the International Monetary Fund 
revised downwards the outlook for global economic growth for the 
coming year to 3.4 per cent.  
 
In the case of Malta growth in real terms is expected to be of 3.5 
per cent and 5.8 per cent in nominal terms. Growth is expected to 
be generated by higher private consumption and investment. 
Private consumption is expected to grow thanks to strong growth 
in employment accompanied by higher net revenues from taxation, 
through a rise in salaries against a background of moderate 
inflation. On the other hand, growth in investment reflects a 
number of projects, both in the private and the public sectors, 
which are expected to be rolled out in the coming years.  
 
In international trade, we are expecting a rise in exports of 2.8 per 
cent for 2017.  Imports are expected to rise by 4.2 during the same 
year as we are expecting a significant increase in imports of 
machinery necessitated by the various projects to be launched in 
2017.  
 
 
 
14 
 
Inflation, in terms of the HICP, is expected to stay at a moderate 
level of 1.5 per cent for next year.  
 
As for employment, we anticipate that job growth will remain 
strong and will be of 2.7 per cent whilst unemployment is expected 
to remain at the record low level of 5 per cent. 
 
In 2017, the deficit is expected to fall to 0.5 per cent and the debt 
burden to 61.9 percent of Gross Domestic Product.  
 
These fiscal estimates further confirm that this Government is 
determined to completely eliminate the fiscal imbalance so that 
Malta would start registering a favourable balance. This, with the 
aim of reducing public debt to less than 60 per cent of the Gross 
Domestic Product signifying the lowest deficit since the start of the 
compilation of figures and the lowest national debt burden in the 
past 18 years.  
 
Cost of Living Adjustment 
 
The Cost Of Living Adjustment (COLA) for next year will be €1.75 
per week. 
 
According to the RPI statistics for September, published this 
morning by the National Statistics Office, which uses a mechanism 
agreed upon by the social partners, the cost of living index 
calculated between October 2015 and September 2016 stood at 
15 
 
€1.16 per week, However, for next year Government decided to 
advance the difference of 59 cents, so that when the cost of living 
rises by more than €1.75 per week, the pay raise would be 
adjusted downwards by this amount. 
 
This is not the first time such an arrangement was made. This 
raise will be given to everyone, including, as per normal practice, 
pensioners and those in receipt of social benefits.  In the case of 
students, the stipend will once again be adjusted upwards pro 
rata.  
 
Fiscal Measures reflecting the reform in the eco-contribution 
 
Following last year’s announcement on the reform in the eco-
contribution, this year I am pleased to announce that the roll-out of 
this reform would be fully completed by the end of the current 
year.  I am therefore announcing the complete removal of this tax 
on batteries, mattresses, detergents and toiletries, vehicle filters 
as well as plastic articles and containers related to kitchen use. 
Therefore the prices of some of these products are expected to 
decrease. 
 
As part of its commitment to environmental responsibility, 
Government felt that although the eco-contribution on products 
should be removed, there was still the need of a more effective 
legislative framework regarding toiletries and batteries because of 
the significant consumption of these items.  
16 
 
Toiletries will be governed by a system of tariffs as of 1st January 
2017 so that importers of such products will have enough time to 
adjust to the new system.  This new system would be fairer both 
from the environmental aspect as well as from a commercial view 
point as this relatively low tariff would be applicable according to 
the volume of the product.  
 
As of tomorrow, the tariff on non-biodegradable black garbage 
bags will go up; a measure intended to encourage people to 
recycle more household refuse in grey and green bags.  
Therefore, these bags, as well as bio-degradable black bags will 
remain completely exempt from customs tariffs.  
 
To further discourage smoking in our country, the price of 
cigarettes and cigars will go up by an average of 3.76 per cent 
whilst the price of loose tobacco will go up by 5.5 per cent. 
 
The tariff on non-alcoholic drinks will go up by 2 cents per litre. 
The rate on bottled water will remain at the current level in order to 
encourage the consumption of healthier beverages which lead to a 
better life-style. 
 
Whilst welcoming the regeneration of the construction industry, we 
believe that measures should be put in place so that this sector 
will compensate for its impact on the environment. Therefore, this 
budget will introduce customs duties on certain materials used in 
the construction industry, particularly in large scale buildings.  The 
17 
 
revenue thus generated could be used for environmental projects 
in the country.  As of 1st January 2017, concrete beams and steel 
structures, steel rods and reinforced wire mesh, glass sheeting 
used for construction and tiles will be subject to customs duty.  
Apart from this, Government wants to ensure that Maltese 
construction companies that pay tariffs on cement are not placed 
at a disadvantage vis-a-vis foreign companies. Therefore, the 
importation of concrete beams and planks will be taxed at a rate 
comparable to that imposed on these items when locally 
produced.  The tables annexed to this speech show the 
adjustments in the customs tariffs regime which will apply to the 
aforementioned products. 
 
Fiscal measures incentivising economic activity 
 
Refund of tax on dividends 
 
As of next year, shareholders in receipt of dividends on profits 
made after 1st January 2017 by companies listed on the Malta 
Stock Exchange, will be given refunds on dividends declared in 
their income tax returns, according to the applicable tax. This 
measure applies to those owning less than 0.5 percent of the 
nominal share capital and dividend rights.  
 
Thus, a substantial number of individuals, including the elderly, 
who invest in the Malta Stock Exchange, will benefit from tax 
rebates.  
 
18 
 
Concession relative to business transfers 
 
As of 2017, we shall be giving a 12 month concession whereby the 
stamp duty of 5 per cent will be reduced to 1.5 per cent, when a 
parent transfers a business to his or her children. This concession 
should assist many family businesses to move forward. 
 
First-time buyers 
 
I am pleased to announce that the concession to first-time buyers 
will once again be extended for a further year.  Young couples and 
individuals who buy their first property, intended for residential 
use, will continue to be exempt from stamp duty on the first 
€150,000 of the purchase price in the coming year. 
 
Refunds to first-time buyers on renovation costs 
 
In order to continue decreasing the costs of renovation works in 
the UCA or other buildings scheduled elsewhere in the First or 
Second Grade, the Planning Authority will be launching two new 
schemes though which first-time buyers will benefit up to a 
maximum of €100,000 on costs incurred.i 
 
 
 
19 
 
Incentives for the purchase of property in Gozo 
 
In addition to this, for one year only, we will be launching a new 
incentive for persons who buy residences in Gozo. Such persons 
will benefit from a reduction in stamp duty, from 5 per cent to 2 per 
cent.  This applies to those entering into a promise of sale 
agreement during 2017, registered with the Inland Revenue 
Department till the 31st December 2017, and where the final 
contract is concluded during the course of 2018. 
 
Inherited property sold by court auction 
 
At present, property coming through inheritance and sold by court 
auction, is taxed at a fixed rate of 7 per cent if the property was 
inherited prior to November 1992.  On the other hand, property 
inherited after this date and sold by court auction, is subject to a 
provisional tax of 7 per cent on capital gains. In such cases, 
therefore, a self-assessment form needs to be filled declaring the 
level of capital gains, and the normal rate of tax is applied. 
 
The need was felt that, in order to bring about more equality 
among heirs involved in court ordered sales and also to simplify 
the process of tax collection on this type of transfer of property, all 
properties emanating from inheritance and transferred by court 
auction will henceforth be taxed at a final rate of 7 per cent. 
 
20 
 
Purchase of vehicles from persons exempt from registration 
tax 
 
The computation of the vehicle registration tax in cases involving 
the purchase of vehicles by persons who are non tax exempt from 
disabled persons who are exempt from paying registration tax  will 
be amended.  Through new arrangements, the amount due will be 
fairly spread out to be paid over a period of ten years. 
 
Registration of lease contracts  
 
We have already introduced the choice of a reduced income tax 
rate of 15 per cent to encourage the declaration of income from 
the leasing of premises, both residential and commercial.  We 
made it clear from the start that controls needed to be put in place 
to address tax evasion on income from this source. 
  
For this reason, as of next year, we shall be introducing a system 
whereby lease agreements for three months or more, including 
renewal agreements will need to be registered with the 
Department of Inland Revenue.  These contracts can be 
registered both by the lessor and/or the lessee but failure to do so 
would lead to the lessor being liable to penalties as stipulated in 
the Income Tax Act.

PROSPERITY THAT REACHES EVERYONE 
 
Mr Speaker, the budgets presented by this Government clearly 
show that Government is following a comprehensive plan with the 
final goal of creating wealth that is felt by all.  The first crucial step 
was to stabilize the economy at all costs, including endorsing the 
budget presented by the preceding administration.  The second 
step was to invest all resources on the generation of wealth 
through job creation.  The third step, the theme of today's budget, 
is to make sure that the wealth created reaches everyone whilst 
continuing on strengthening the economy. 
 
While many are talking about poverty and the risk of poverty, 
through its plan this Government is implementing a number of 
measures which will ultimately result in thousands of families 
getting out of poverty or out of the risk of poverty. 
 
For this Government, poverty is not a perception but a reality 
against which we are taking action.  
 
Mr Speaker, I can say this because the principal causes leading 
families to fall into poverty are known to this Government.  These 
are unemployment, low paid work - mainly for those who our 
education system has failed to adequately train, old age - 
particularly in households that depend on a single pension, and 
finally, those families with health and other issues which force 
them to depend on the state for their living.  All these are being 
addressed.  
36 
 
Wealth creation through employment 
 
In the first nine months of this legislature that is, in 2013, 
Government succeeding in halting the increase in the number of 
families at risk of poverty or social exclusion. In the following year, 
Government managed to reduce the number of persons at risk of 
poverty or social exclusion by 5,000. This was the first reduction in 
ten years. This was reported not by Government but by Eurostat. 
 
All this was achieved with job creation. The number of reforms 
presented through the budgetary measures succeeded in reducing 
unemployment, encouraging more persons particularly women to 
enter into employment, and other persons to choose work instead 
of dependence on social security benefits. All these persons are 
families which benefited from new sources of income and earned 
the respect acquired by families who are financially independent. 
 
When we started the tapering scheme, there were 1,322 persons 
on social assistance, with a substantial part being single parents, 
who found employment. While another 2,050 persons who were 
receiving unemployment assistance for more than two years, 
found employment. A total of 3,450 persons. 
 
 
37 
 
Assistance to low income earners 
 
In the last two budgets we introduced the In-Work Benefit, which 
while supplementing low income earners, served as an incentive 
for heads of families with children to go out to work and still benefit 
from a subsidy of €1,000 for each child. This year the scheme is 
being extended to include couples with children where only one 
member is gainfully employed.  
 
In this budget, we will be strengthening and improving the benefits 
applicable under both schemes. 
 
Firstly, we shall be raising the ceilings of both schemes. i  In 
addition we shall be raising the rate of the In-Work Benefit for each 
child under 23 years of age. 
 
For couples who both work, this will mean an increase of €200 a 
year according to their income so that the benefit will now go up 
from €1,000 to €1,200 for each child. 
 
For single parents who are gainfully occupied, the rate is being 
raised by €50 per annum to €1,250, whilst for couples where only 
one person works, the rate will go up by a minimum of €150 to a 
maximum of €350 per annum, according to their income. Thus we 
would be covering 3,000 low to medium income families who will 
see an improvement in their purchasing power.  
 
38 
 
More details are shown in the note at the end of the chapter (Table 
2.1). 
 
Raising Supplementary Assistance 
 
In the course of the coming year we shall be implementing an 
important reform in the Supplementary Assistance paid to married 
low income earners, including those on the minimum wage, who 
do not have children under the age of 16 and therefore do not 
benefit from the Children's Allowance.  
 
This reform entails raising the current ceiling for Supplementary 
Assistance for married couples from €11,089 to €13,000. But not 
just married couples who will benefit from this reform.  Single 
persons living on their own, who work, and have a net income of 
less than €9,012, as well as other single persons who work and 
earn the Minimum Wage and whose net income does not exceed 
€9,012 will be receiving an annual rise of €126.36. 
 
This reform will benefit around 11,000 couples and 5,000 single 
persons, who are employed - a total of 27,000 persons. 
 
The measures I have just announced, that is, the In-Work Benefit 
and the Supplementary Assistance, together with the Cost of 
Living Adjustment, will improve considerably the income of 
Maltese and Gozitan families. The highest rises will go to families 
that are employed but have a low to medium income. At the same 
39 
 
time we want to strengthen the notion that a parent is better off in 
employment.  
 
Through these reforms, and taking into consideration the COLA, 
all those on the Minimum Wage will be getting a rise of at least €4 
per week or €208 per year. This increase will be borne completely 
by Government. 
 
The table at the end of the chapter gives the full picture of the 
effects of the measures announced that favour the family. (Table 
2.2). 
 
Assisting Pensioners 
 
Minimum Pensions for Married Couples 
 
Mr Speaker, in this budget we shall be raising pensions again for 
the second consecutive year.  This follows a 25 year period where 
pensions had remained at the same level. 
 
In the last budget, we raised the minimum pension to €140 per 
week for thousands of pensioners.  In doing this, Government 
succeeded in doing what previous administrations had not 
managed to do for years on end. We raised the minimum pension 
for married couples living on one pension by €4.15 per week. 
 
40 
 
We feel that this year we should continue bettering the lives of 
pensioners and elderly married couples who only have a minimum 
pension.  Therefore, as of January of next year, we shall be giving 
another rise of €4 per week (equivalent to €208 per year).  This 
rise will be given pro rata to those whose pension is slightly higher 
than the Minimum Pension. 
 
The increase in pension will also be paid to married pensioners 
who receive the Old Age Pension.  This measure will benefit 2,500 
married pensioners. 
 
Tax-Free Pensions 
 
This budget will be introducing another far-reaching reform 
whereby pensioners aged over 61 will no longer pay tax on the 
pension or pensions they might have from different sources such 
as social security pensions, treasury pensions as well as other 
local or foreign pensions, up to a maximum of €13,000.  This 
reform will be spread over a period of two years.  At the end of the 
two years a pensioner would have benefited from tax cuts up to a 
maximum of €585 per annum. ii 
 
Mr Speaker, this is a measure that is expected to benefit no less 
than 22,000 pensioners.  Moreover, this also means that more 
than 9,000 pensioners would no longer be subject to income tax. 
 
41 
 
In order to retain the fiscal equity that exists between single and 
married computations, in the case of married pensioners, apart 
from the total removal of income tax on pensions up to €13,000, 
another tax-free amount will come into effect with respect to 
income from any source up to a maximum of €1,000. 
 
This measure will come into effect over the coming two years. 
 
Persons on a single rate will be benefiting from a tax-free pension 
income up to €10,500 in 2017, going up to €13,000 in 2018.  
Persons on the married rate will benefit from the full tax-free 
amount for pension that is up to €13,000 as of 2017.  The other 
tax-free income for married pensioners will be spread out to cover 
€500 in 2017 going up to €1,000 in 2018. 
 
Pensioners qualifying for the parent rates will also benefit from this 
measure since in 2017 a tax-free pension income on the first 
€11,500 will apply for each parent. In 2018, this amount will go up 
to cover the first €13,000.  (Table 2.3) 
 
Supplementary Assistance for the Elderly 
 
The supplementary assistance for minimum wage earners which I 
have previously announced will also be given to low income 
pensioners. Through this reform, we would be significantly 
augmenting the income of around 9,500 married pensioners living 
on just one pension. This measure will also benefit those married 
42 
 
pensioners who would not be benefiting from tax-free pension 
income. Vide Table 2.4 for more details. 
 
€300 annual grant 
 
Once again, the €300 annual grant will be given to persons over 
75 (seventy five) years of age still residing in their own homes.  
 
Bonus for persons who paid National Insurance contributions 
but do not have a pension 
 
For the first time in the budget for 2014,  we had introduced a 
bonus that was paid every year to persons, mostly married 
women, who had paid national insurance contributions at some 
point in their life but not enough contributions for them to qualify 
for a pension.  As of 1st January 2017, we will be raising this 
bonus by another €50 per year.  Thus, the bonus payable to those 
who reach retirement age but are less than 75 years old and who 
have paid more than one year but less than five years of 
contributions, will go up from €100 to €150, whilst the bonus for 
those with more than 5 years' worth of contributions will go up 
from €200 to €250 per annum.  This measure will benefit around 
12,500 persons. 
 
 
43 
 
Service Pensioners 
 
As of next year we shall once again add another €200 to the 
amount of Service pension which is deducted from the social 
security pension.  This measure will affect around 5,000 Service 
pensioners. 
 
Elimination of gender based discrimination 
 
During this year, Cabinet and later Parliament approved 
amendments to the Social Security Act, removing any form of 
discrimination on the basis of gender which had been around for 
many years. 
 
Through these amendments, all differences in fixed or minimum 
rates payable to males and females would be eliminated. We are 
revising the pensions payable to females to remove any 
discrimination. Women will benefit from an increase in their 
pension which can go up to a maximum of €20 per week. 
 
Reform of the Carers’ Pension and the Carers’ Allowance 
 
This Government will continue encouraging the elderly to live in 
their own homes and in their communities.  This creates a greater 
sense of dignity for such persons. With pleasure, I can announce 
today that the reform in the Carers' Pension and the Carers' 
Allowance will be implemented in the course of the coming year. 
With this reform, the benefit will be raised substantially while the 
44 
 
Carers’ Pension would be payable without the need of means 
testing.  The benefit will be of €140 per week, which signifies an 
increase of €35 per week or an increase of €1,820 per year over 
the current amount of the Carers' Pension. 
 
As of 2017, the current Carers' Pension which is only payable after 
means-testing the carers’ income and in cases where the patient 
is wheelchair bound or bedridden, will be termed an Increased 
Carers' Allowance and will be payable to those carers, including 
spouses, under some conditions, who would be giving care in their 
residence to a person with a high level of dependence. 
 
On the other hand, the Carers' Allowance will be paid to carers 
who take care of persons with medium level of dependence in 
their own residence. The rate of Carers' Allowance would be of 
€90 per week which means an increase of €14 per week or €728 
per year over the current rate. In these cases, the eligibility to 
benefit would still be subject to a test of the carer's means.  
 
The assessment of the degree of dependence will be carried out 
by professionals who will make use of the Barthel Index and the 
Mini-Mental Score.  In this manner, we would be doing justice with 
persons who choose the difficult vocation of caring for relatives 
needing constant support whilst assisting the elderly, in particular, 
to continue to reside in their communities, in the loving care of 
their relatives. 
 
45 
 
COLA for pensioners 
 
As already mentioned in the beginning of this speech, all pensions 
will increase by the full amount of the cost of living adjustment.  As 
in previous years, part of the increase will be paid out as part of 
the pension whilst the remaining balance would be paid out as part 
of the cost of living bonus.  Social assistance allowances will 
increase by two thirds of the cost of living adjustment as in 
previous years. 
 
The tables at the end of this chapter show the full effect of the €4 
per week rise, the Supplementary Allowance and the COLA for 
pensioners. (Table 2.4) 
 
Reform of the Disability Pension 
 
Beyond doubt, persons with disability are the focal point of this 
Government's social policy.  In our Electoral Programme, we 
promised to enhance benefits paid out to persons with disability.  
In 2014, we increased the Disabled Children's Allowance. In 2015, 
we introduced the measure where all other income from 
employment was being ignored for the purpose of calculating the 
Disability Pension. 
 
It is now time to take a further step and think of those who, 
because of their disability, will never be in a position to be gainfully 
occupied and have a chance of supplementing their pension with 
income from employment.  For this reason, as of next year we 
46 
 
shall be implementing a reform which will put in place three tiers of 
payment according to the degree of disability. 
 
The first tier will include disabled persons who, according to the 
Barthel Index, cannot possibly participate in gainful occupation.  
Such persons will be receiving the highest level of allowance. This 
will be raised gradually so that eventually it becomes equivalent to 
the net amount received by a person on the Minimum Wage. 
 
The second tier will be the same as that applicable today and will 
include all those persons whose disability falls within the 
parameters of the Social Security Act and who are working or are 
able to work. In this case, Government intends to carry on with the 
reform which has facilitated the gainful employment of hundreds of 
disabled persons for the first time.  
 
The third tier will gradually take up a number of disabilities which 
to date are not covered by law and persons who to date receive no 
benefits.  This will mean the fulfilment of another electoral pledge 
which concerns persons under 60 who, although missing one arm 
or one leg, to date do not qualify as persons with disability for the 
purpose of the Disability Pension. 
 
In addition, for persons receiving the Disability Pension in the first 
tier mentioned above, income arising from some other benefit or 
pension, even from foreign sources, will no longer be considered 
in the assessment of eligibility for the Pink Card.  And for persons 
47 
 
within the second tier, income from employment will no longer be 
considered in the assessment for Pink Card eligibility.  We feel 
that with this measure, we are being more just with disabled 
persons since many of them require medical attention.  
 
Another measure, which will be implemented, will make it possible 
for recipients of the Disability Pension and who are entitled to free 
medication to have a Pink Card that is valid for one year rather 
than for three months as is the practice today.  This would relieve 
much hardship and inconvenience faced currently by these 
persons or their relatives. 
 
Revision of Rent Subsidy 
 
The robust economic growth our country has experienced in the 
past few years has led to a strong demand for property and this in 
turn has impacted real estate prices and rents.  Government will 
be taking concrete steps to assist vulnerable families who are 
most hard hit by these market dynamics. Therefore for the coming 
year, Government will be doubling the subsidy currently given to 
around 1,400 families.  
 
This subsidy currently varies between €66.67 to €83.33 monthly 
according to family size and income. This will be doubled, 
meaning it will rise between €133.34 and €166.66.  We shall also 
be extending the criteria under which families qualify for this 
48 
 
subsidy and the goal is to double the number of families benefiting 
from this scheme from 1,400 to 2,800. 
 
To qualify for the increase in rent subsidy, tenants need to show 
their rent contract. Tenants, who are registered in the present rent 
subsidy scheme and fail to present their rent contract, will not 
benefit from the increase in the rent subsidy. 
 
Revision of minimum rent on Government rented housing 
 
As a result of the amendments to the Civil Code regarding the 
lease of property, introduced by Government before 2009, the 
minimum amount of rent for residential property was extended to 
apply not only to residential property leased out by  private owners 
but also to those residencies rented from the Government/Housing 
Authority.  
 
Over the years, this part of the law was automatically applied 
across the board and thus rent for residencies leased from 
Government was adjusted according to the minimum rent 
established by law in 2010, 2013 and 2016 respectively.   
Government took action to correct this.  
 
As of next year, this part of the Civil Code will no longer apply, and 
therefore the increase in rent upon renewal will no longer apply to 
leases of residential property from Government/Housing Authority. 
 
49 
 
Moreover the excess rent paid on such residences since 2013 will 
be refunded.iii 
 
Preferential rates on certain leases 
 
In order to ensure that low income families have more peace of 
mind with regards to the residential property they rent, 
Government will be launching a pilot project of 100 cases.  Those 
property owners leasing residential premises to low income 
families and who offer longer term contracts of seven years will be 
taxed at the preferential rate of 5 per cent on the income from 
such leases. This does not apply in the case of Special 
Designated Areas.  In the course of the coming weeks, we shall be 
announcing the criteria governing the application of this provision. 
 
Setting up of a fund to address past grievances 
 
Government is aware that changes affecting the pensions system 
from time to time may have brought about certain anomalies which 
were perceived as grievous injustices by those who were affected 
and who therefore, were unable to find that peace of mind that 
was critical in that period of their life, their old age. We are 
referring to former Labour Corps employees in the 1970s, former 
employees of the Malta Electricity Board, the overtime payments 
due to members of the Police Force, former port workers and 
others. 
 
50 
 
We have always maintained that for the state to make good on 
these complaints, it would need to allocate hundreds of millions of 
euro.  On the other hand, these grievances and complaints cannot 
be ignored.  Previous administrations, for reasons known only to 
them, never acknowledged these grievances.  We will however, as 
pledged, address these complaints over the course of a number of 
years. 
 
We had already taken the first step when we recently paid out all 
amounts due to former Sea Malta employees. 
 
It is my pleasure to announce that in this budget we will be taking 
an important step with the allocation of €8 million for the setting up 
of a fund from which we will be making the initial payments to 
persons from among those I mentioned earlier.  
 
Our intention is to set up a board to manage this fund and, 
following consultations, develop a mechanism and put in place  
the right procedures  to ensure that these grievances are properly 
addressed and the relative sums are paid out in a transparent and 
accountable manner over a number of years. 
 
Hopefully this will heal a wound that has festered for years.  
 
 
 
51 
 
Subsidy for Care Worker home service for the elderly 
 
Government is continually striving to enhance services in the 
community, making it possible for the elderly to continue to reside 
in their own homes, close to their loved ones.  For this year, 
Government will be allocating another sum for the extension of the 
Carer at Home project.  Through this scheme, elderly persons on 
the waiting list for admittance to any one of the homes for the 
elderly, will have the possibility of engaging a care worker of their 
choice, to care for them on a full-time or part-time basis and 
receive proportionate financial assistance, up to a maximum of 
€5,200 per annum. 
 
Government Savings Bonds for Pensioners 
 
In the last few years, the interest rate on fixed bank accounts 
declined substantially. For pensioners, this is resulting in a 
significant reduction in additional income earned from interest. In 
this light, in order to enhance these pensioners’ income, we will be 
amending the law governing Malta’s Treasury Bills to be able to 
include bonds having attractive rates specifically tailored for 
pensioners. This will enable pensioners to invest in Government 
bonds with interest rates that are higher than those offered by the 
private sector.

Revision of the means test 
 
As pledged in our electoral programme, we shall be gradually 
revising the capital limits beneath which persons with a low 
income or at the risk of poverty could qualify for non-contributory 
benefits.  The intention is to make the thresholds more realistic.  
Thus persons in need could be assisted and brought out of the risk 
of poverty. 
 
At the same time we need to keep a balance between the 
assistance we are duty bound to give to those who really need it, 
and this government's policy of reducing dependence on social 
benefits, a policy which has been very successful over the past 
three years. 
 
Therefore, as part of the intended reform in the means testing 
mechanism we shall be creating a single threshold for all non-
contributory assistance, including the Pink Card. This single 
threshold will be of €23,000 for married couples and €14,000 for 
single persons.   This means that the capital limit to qualify for the 
Pink Card will go up by €7,000 for couples and by €4,700 for 
single persons.   
 
This reform is expected to benefit around 1,000 persons, mostly 
elderly people and pensioners who will now qualify for the Pink 
Card entitling them to free medicine.

Conclusion 
 
Mr Speaker, these measures are all aimed at boosting the income 
of thousands of families, whatever the circumstances that may 
have led them to having a low income.  This Government is 
making sure that these families will never be forgotten and that the 
wealth created would reach everyone. I conclude with this 
Government’s pledge, that within three years no child coming from 
a working family would live in poverty.

i  For couples who both work, the ceiling is being raised from €20,400 to 
€24,000 per annum.  For single parents in employment, the ceiling will increase 
from €15,000 to €16,500 per annum; whilst for couples where only one person 
works the ceiling is being raised from €13,000 to €16,500 per annum. 
 
ii  Since we wanted the maximum financial gain to be the same for every level of 
individual income, the existing tax brackets and their rates would apply 
respectively for income in excess of €13,000. This income would be taxed at the 
rate of 15, 25 or 35 per cent respectively. 
 
iii  This provision applies specifically and solely to those residential premises, 
which are property of the Government or the Housing Authority and which were 
subjected to an increase in rent since according to Section 1531c of the Civil 
Code the rent was less than the established minimum.  Therefore, this does 
not apply to cases where the increases in rent resulted for instance from a 
revision of rent emanating from the lease contract itself, which cases are not 
covered by this provision. 
63 
 
INVESTING IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING 
 
Mr Speaker, this Government considers education and training not 
only as the principal foundation on which the economic 
development of the country relies, but also as a means of reaching 
out equitably towards more children and young people, providing 
them with the necessary skills to find jobs that would assist them 
and their families to rise out of poverty.  
 
Fair and quality tuition 
 
We shall continue our work in favour of literacy through the 
enhancement of services offered by public libraries and the 
National Literacy Agency.  At the same time two new centres will 
be opened offering a Programme for Literacy in the Family 
(NWAR). 
 
We shall strengthen the scholastic year course, as well as the 
intensive summer course in spoken Maltese and English for 
foreign students who cannot communicate either in Maltese or in 
English.  We shall open another National Curriculum Centre in 
Gozo. 
 
 
64 
 
Overcoming illiteracy through sport 
 
In 2017, we shall launch a new programme that has been specially 
devised to overcome illiteracy in our schools through sport.  The 
aim of this project is to use football as a means of helping these 
children by teaching them to read and enjoy reading. 
 
This programme will start during the coming year in four schools, 
each one in a different region, that is, Cospicua, Birkirkara, St 
Paul's Bay and in Rabat, Gozo. 
 
Building of schools and educational centres 
 
This Government will not build one school in the coming year, as 
the previous administration claimed it did, but will build three 
schools in the same way that was done in the last two years.  We 
shall be building three new primary schools in St Paul's Bay, 
Marsascala and Rabat, Gozo. 
 
Furthermore, we shall open a new childcare centre in St Julian's 
Primary School and we shall extend the Rabat Gozo Primary so 
that the school will operate from a single building. 
 
We shall build a new assembly hall in St Lucia Secondary School 
and upgrade educational facilities at the Guardian Angel School in 
Ħamrun as well as provide new educational facilities for the San 
Miguel Resource Centre. 
 
65 
 
Stipends 
 
We shall continue to honour our commitment to improve stipends 
for students in post-secondary, higher and tertiary institutions.  
 
For another year we shall increase stipends pro rata in line with 
the cost of living adjustment.  
 
We shall revise the thresholds of student income with respect to 
their eligibility for supplementary assistance. 
 
Students with disabilities as well as students residing in Church 
homes and conservatories, among others, will henceforth be 
automatically eligible for maintenance grants, including the 
supplementary assistance. 
 
Students who undertake an additional year in their course will start 
to receive a stipend for the additional year and hence, will be 
regarded as students who repeat a year in their course. 
 
As of next year, full-time students under the age of 24 and who are 
engaged in economic activity as self-employed persons will be 
able to pay pro rata national insurance contributions at the rate of 
15 per cent on their net income from any such activity.  
 
 
66 
 
As from this scholastic year, students who turn sixteen and 
continue their studies or training at the Alternative Learning 
Programme in Paola at Level 3 of the Malta Qualifications 
Framework in hospitality and customer care as well as in welding 
and fabrication will also become eligible for the award of stipends.  
 
Students who decide to enrol in courses that lead to relatively 
lower qualifications than other courses will still receive their 
stipends. 
 
Technology in education 
 
This year will see the introduction of educational tablets in year 
four primary school classes in all Government, Church and 
independent schools.  
 
We shall continue to improve infrastructure and WIFI access in 
schools and replace all PCs which have been in use for more than 
eight years in primary school classes.  
 
Skills Council 
 
We shall launch the Skills Council where economic stakeholders 
will be brought into contact with education officers to analyse the 
competences and skills that will be required in the coming years 
so that our educational institutions will adequately train students 
for the new work opportunities that are being created.  
 
67 
 
Training for Teachers 
 
The Institute of Learning will continue to facilitate on-going training 
of all educators who are either new recruits or in service.  All 
educators will be assisted in improving pedagogy and keeping 
abreast of new learning and teaching methods by the use of 
modern means, including on-line courses.  The aim is for all 
educators to be equipped to offer high quality teaching.  
 
The Government will enter into agreements with local and foreign 
universities to provide training for teachers on the pedagogy of 
vocational subjects. This will enable them to teach vocational 
subjects at secondary level.  
 
For next year we shall also allocate €400,000 for teachers in state 
and other schools who apply for sabbatical leave with pay to 
further their studies.  
 
More investment in the University of Malta.... 
 
Works will continue on capital projects undertaken by the 
University of Malta including the extension of the Material 
Engineering Lab and the Mathematics and Physics buildings, a 
building for Postdoc, a multi-religion building, and the renovation of 
the campuses in Valletta and the Junior College.  The Government 
will contribute towards the building of a University Residence and 
Community Car Park in Tal-Qroqq.i 
 
68 
 
.... and the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology, 
MCAST 
 
At the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology work will 
continue on the development of a new campus overlying the 
Institute of Energy and Transport, the Library and the Learning 
Support Unit. 
 
We shall invest in courses and services in the maritime sector in 
collaboration with strategic partners as well as in new resources 
for the Institute of Creative Arts. 
 
By reforming the apprenticeship scheme, we will also ensure that 
apprentices are given high quality training. 
 
The College will introduce a Research Framework to improve the 
level of teaching through relevant research and co-operation 
between students and industry as well as between MCAST and 
industry. 
 
Science, research and innovation 
 
Through the Explora Science Centre, which cost around €26 
million, half of which came from European funds, we shall have 
the first interactive science centre with other related activities, to 
make science more popular and encourage more students to opt 
to study science in the future. Our long term vision is for Malta to 
have more science professionals than we have today so that our 
69 
 
country will have the human capital which is so necessary for 
economic competitiveness based on knowledge - the so called 
knowledge based economy. 
 
At the same time, we shall continue to assist local researchers to 
obtain the support they need in their work through Horizon 2020 
and by means of other financial schemes.ii   
 
Training 
 
With the aim of investing in human resources and reinforcing our 
commitment to pave the way for every individual who would like to 
progress further, Jobsplus will continue its programmes including 
Work Exposure, Traineeships, Access to Employment, Training 
Pays and the Community Work Scheme.  More jobs will also be 
created through the Document Management System for Public 
Documents for persons with disabilities who seek employment.iii 
 
A low rate of unemployment among young people does not 
happen by chance. This explains why we have drawn up a plan of 
reforms which prioritises an inclusive society that looks ahead 
towards opportunities rather than obstacles.  Through the Work 
Programme Initiative we shall continue to collaborate with the 
private sector to assist persons aged 25 who have been seeking 
employment for 12 months or over.   At the same time, we shall 
still make available the Youth Guarantee to ensure that Malta 
achieves the lowest rate of unemployment amongst youths. 
70 
 
 
By means of these initiatives we are placing the development of 
skills and opportunities for every individual at the very heart of this 
Government's policy.  All this will take place as we reinforce our 
relations with employers with the aim of maintaining the same rate 
of progress as that achieved by demand in the labour market. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
i For all these projects there is an allocation of over €7 million during the coming 
year. 
 
ii  We are also prepared to consider a proposal made by the Chamber of 
Commerce earlier this year regarding the setting up of an organisation 
comprising representatives of the Chamber and other institutions such as the 
University, Malta Enterprise and MCAST.  The aim of this proposal is for 
members of this organisation to work together so that industry and academic 
institutions could implement research programmes on the commercialisation of 
products and their marketing. 
 
iii  These various schemes organised by Jobsplus are aimed at offering training 
in skills and trades which are in demand, giving participants hands on 
experience in skills or trades of their choice and assisting them in obtaining the 
necessary self confidence to facilitate the transition from a training programme 
to the reality of work place. 
71 
 
A STRONG INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A STRONG ECONOMY 
 
The great strides our economy has made in the past three years 
with the large numbers of foreign visitors and the record number of 
persons who leave their homes for work every day are creating 
new 
challenges 
for 
our 
infrastructure 
and 
environment. 
Government is prepared to keep investing heavily and to 
encourage the private sector to invest as well for us to have the 
infrastructure that befits the country.  However, Government needs 
to make sure this development is sustainable in order to keep the 
balance required for the protection of the environment. 
 
Energy 
 
The transformation of Enemalta continues, following another 
upgrade by the credit rating agencies.  This comes about on the 
strength of an 80 million Euro investment by Enemalta over the 
past three years in the distribution system. 
 
The time has now come for the country to reap the benefits of the 
new gas powered plant, particularly at a time when the 
international price of oil is once again on the rise.   
 
Soon we shall be closing down completely the plants that run on 
heavy fuel oil and commission the two plants that generate 
electricity using natural gas.  
 
72 
 
Following this development, the Marsa Power Station will no 
longer be kept on cold standby and will be decommissioned 
completely,  followed  by the dismantling of turbines, boilers and 
chimneys so that the regeneration of the Marsa area can take off.  
2017 will also see the dismantling of the oldest section of the 
Delimara Power Station which includes boilers, steam turbines 
and the 150 meter chimney which continually discharges carbon 
emissions.i 
 
At this point it should be said that during the current year the 
average electricity outage was of only 63 minutes down from the  
average of 4 hours we had prior to 2013. 
 
Gas pipeline from Sicily 
 
We shall also continue with the implementation of our pledge to 
lay down a gas pipeline which connects us with Gela in Sicily. 
 
In 2016 work was taken in hand to identify a corridor on the 
seabed where the pipeline could be laid; the sites where the 
pipeline could link up to the gas grid in Sicily and Malta; the issue 
of the necessary environmental permits and the best possible 
location of the link between the pipeline and the gas system at the  
Delimara station.  Geological tests are also being carried out to 
identify the best underground route for the pipeline in Delimara.ii 
 
 
73 
 
Fuel Storage 
 
At the same time Enemed will be modernising the fuel storage 
plant at Ħas-Saptan and will be developing a new filling station at 
a cost in excess of €50 million. This would be in fulfilment of 
another of our pledges, that is, the complete closure of the 31st 
March plant in Birżebbuġa, which people living in the South of 
Malta know to be the real and present danger in their midst.  
 
Enemed is also in the process of modernising the jet fuel storage 
facilities at the airport - an investment of over €15 million.  Works 
on this project are expected to commence in the first months of the 
coming year. 
 
Renewable energy 
 
In the fields of renewable energy and the efficient use of 
renewable energy sources, the Energy and Water Agency, set up 
precisely for this purpose, has several ongoing initiatives with 
respect to sustainability, security of supply and the affordability of 
energy and water in Malta.iii 
 
By the end of this year we expect to reach half the goal of 10% 
which we must reach by 2020.  Thus, by the end of this year Malta 
will have between 95 and 100 megawatt peak of photovoltaic 
installations thanks to innovative and sustainable schemes. 
 
 
74 
 
In 2016, preparatory work was carried out in order to allow people 
who do not have access to a roof, the opportunity to invest in 
renewable energy at a community solar farm overlying the water 
reservoir at tal-Fiddien. iv  In August of this year the European 
Commission approved a €140 million scheme for large scale 
renewable energy installations. v  In 2017 we shall continue to 
issue fresh grants for householders who wish to install 
photovoltaic panels on their residences.  
 
Other schemes will be rolled out as incentives for the installation of 
heat pump water heaters, double glazing, roof insulation, solar 
water heaters and the restoration of household wells.  We 
estimate that these schemes would assist around 1,000 families 
and through them alone we would be reducing around 440 metric 
tons of CO2. 
 
The Conservation Unit (Energy and Water Agency) will continue to 
assess the potential of school roofs to be used for the production 
of additional renewable energy whilst the first solar farms will be 
built in collaboration with the Water Services Corporation, the 
GRTU and the Malta Developers Association.  The installation of 
the panels will commence next year.vi 
 
Another scheme pertaining to energy audits of SMEs developed 
by the same agency and administered by Malta Enterprise, will be 
rolled out after consultation and in collaboration with the GRTU.vii 
 
75 
 
Within the scope of an initiative for the more efficient use of 
energy, Malta Enterprise is expected to promote the development 
of a scheme whereby enterprises with high energy consumption 
will be given assistance to invest in systems and machinery that 
will enable them to be more efficient in the use of energy. 
 
We shall also carry on with the campaign of house calls aimed at 
spreading information about the wise use of energy and water and 
advice in this regard. 
 
We also felt the need to launch a grants scheme to promote the 
replacement of old appliances.  For this purpose a scheme of eco 
cheques will be set in motion to assist the more vulnerable groups 
to replace refrigerators, air conditioners and tumble dryers with 
modern models that are more economical.viii 
 
Agreement on savings on energy consumption 
 
In the course of next year, we shall be operating a scheme for 
hotels, agreed between the Energy and Water Agency and the 
MHRA, whereby members of this association will benefit from a 
system of rewards related to savings registered in their energy 
consumption.ix 
 
 
 
76 
 
Issue of solar bonds for the general public  
 
Following the acquisition of European Union funds for the 
development of solar schemes and in a bid to reach national 
targets for renewable energy, in the coming months Malita plc in 
partnership with Malta Government Investments Ltd will be floating 
solar bonds on the market which may be taken up by the general 
public.  
 
These bonds will finance the leasing of solar panel systems to be 
installed on commercial establishments.  Thus enterprises 
investing in these systems would have an added source of 
financing.  The bonds will also be used to finance solar systems in 
public areas which will be identified in the coming months.x 
 
Water 
 
This year, the Water Services Corporation completed works on 
three polishing plants in the limits  of Taċ-Ċumnija in Mellieħa, at 
Ras il-Ħobż in Gozo and at Ta' Barkat in Xgħajra for the tertiary 
treatment of urban waste water as an alternative source of water 
for agriculture and industry.  Upon successful commissioning and 
testing, these plants would produce an additional seven million 
cubic meters of water. 
 
 
 
77 
 
In the second phase of this project we shall be putting in place the 
infrastructure for the distribution of this water by means of 
electronic dispensers that work with top-up cards.  The project is 
expected to cover some 1,200 hectares of agricultural land. 
 
At a cost of €1.5 million we shall be carrying out landscaping 
works to improve the environment and embellish the area 
surrounding the Ta' Barkat plant to alleviate the problem of foul 
smells, particularly for the residents of Xgħajra. 
 
In the course of next year the Corporation will be renewing the 
drainage system in Triq Cachia Żammit in Żejtun at a cost of €1.5 
million to solve the drainage problem that has been accumulating 
in the area for some time.  This project would be similar to the one 
carried out in Baħrija this year. 
 
With regards to Baħrija, next year will see the completion of the 
resurfacing of the whole of Triq in-Nigra as well as the installation 
of lighting in the principal road and the renovation of recreational 
facilities for children.xi 
 
In 2017 the Energy and Water Agency will be opening a National 
Centre for the Conservation of Water in the neighbourhood of 
Nigret in Rabat. 
 
 
 
78 
 
In order to have in place adequate infrastructure for rainwater 
harvesting and to restore existing facilities, European Union funds 
will be utilised for the rehabilitation of the water dams in Wied il-
Qlejjgħa (Chadwick Lakes) and the restoration of various other 
minor water dams. 
 
Public Transport 
 
The encouraging rise in the number of passengers making use of 
public transport is a clear sign that gradually the Maltese public is 
regaining confidence in this service. During the last year public 
transport carried over 40 million passengers, an increase of 7% on 
the previous year and a rise of 18% when compared with 2012. 
 
We shall continue to insist with the public transport provider for 
further improvement of the service both with regards to frequency 
and punctuality as well as the level of service offered to 
passengers.  
 
Refund of VAT on car registration 
 
As promised, this year we continued to issue payments fo ex 
gratia refunds on tax paid on additional vehicle registration to 
persons who had registered vehicles between 1st May 2004 and 
31st December 2008.xii 
 
 
 
79 
 
Road Traffic 
 
This Government will not ignore the challenge of traffic increase in 
the country which is a reality faced by people on our roads every 
day. This is not something that started overnight but is an 
accumulation of lack of planning over a number of years. 
 
Our country, particularly over the past three years, has grown at a 
very fast rate.  Today we have 24,000 more people commuting to 
work every day whilst the number of tourists is ever on the rise.  
Undoubtedly, increased traffic reflects the economic situation of 
the country.  Whilst the rise in car registration in 2012 stood at 1.4 
per cent, in the past three years this has exceeded 3.4 per cent 
each year, representing an increase of 12,000 vehicles on our 
roads every year.  
 
Whilst striving to improve public transport and providing better 
infrastructure, we shall be taking further measures to offer 
incentives to particular groups in a way that rewards the use of 
organised transport. 
 
Tax credits for worker transport 
 
As of 2017 we shall be giving tax rebates of 150%, up to a 
maximum of €35,000 per year, for costs incurred by companies 
that provide employee transport on their own and up to a 
maximum of €50,000 per year for companies that operate this 
80 
 
service in partnership with other companies when the transport of 
workers is provided free of charge. 
 
A plan for sustainable transport by public entities 
 
This government shall be leading by example. As of next year we 
shall be expecting government entities employing more than 50 
persons to come up with a plan for sustainable group transport.xiii 
 
One year of free travel on public transport 
 
In an effort to encourage more people to use public transport 
instead of their own private vehicle, every young person reaching 
the age of 18 in the course of 2017, will be given a one year free 
travel pass for public transport amounting to a maximum of €312 
for every young person.xiv 
 
Investment in cleaner means of transport 
 
In the last budget we introduced an incentive for enterprises that 
invest in bicycle racks for the parking of their employees' bicycles 
when these opted to use this means of transport to commute to 
work.  This scheme will be extended for another year.xv 
 
 
 
81 
 
Road development and other works 
 
In the roads sector, in 2017 we will be concentrating mainly on 
works related to the Kappara project with the aim of completing 
these works by the end of next year. At the same time we shall be 
taking in hand all necessary preparatory work so that upon the 
completion of the Kappara junction project, works could start on 
the Marsa project in the shortest possible time.xvi 
 
In 2017 we shall also start works on the rehabilitation of the Triton 
fountain and the surrounding area. 
 
In addition, we are planning to start works on the widening of the 
Hamrun bypass between the Santa Venera tunnels and the slip 
road leading to Ħal Qormi; a new junction at High Ridge in St 
Andrews; a junction in Mosta where Labour Avenue joins the 
Mosta ring road; and other roads in Tal-Qajjenza, Żurrieq, Ħal 
Safi, Vittoriosa and Valletta.  Other works will be taken in hand on 
maintenance and repairs on arterial and distributor roads as well 
as the asphalting of new residential roads. 
 
In the field of oil exploration we shall be setting up a national 
company to regulate operations in this sector. 
 
 
 
82 
 
Projects in the tourism sector 
 
Project in the Grand Harbour for Cruise Liners 
 
This year we are expecting over 700,000 passengers to visit Malta 
on cruise liners that call at Grand Harbour for a few hours. This is 
a sector we need to exploit further. 
 
Between 2017 and 2020 around 40 new vessels will be entering 
the cruise liner industry. The majority of these will exceed 300 
meters. 
 
In order to expand this sector and be prepared for the future, we 
shall be widening Pinto Wharf by another 15 meters so as to have 
a second quay which can accommodate cruise liners of over 300 
meters. 
 
We shall also be encouraging home porting as this is another 
source of attracting more visitors to the island. 
 
It is also planned to start talks regarding the expansion of the 
Deep Water Quay. 
 
 
 
83 
 
Institute of Tourism Studies 
 
We have already announced an investment of over €56 million for 
a new campus for the Institute of Tourism Studies in Smart City 
which will improve teaching quality in the hospitality sector.  Work 
on the Smart City complex is expected to start at the beginning of 
2017. 
 
Improving the general look of the country 
 
Infrastructural improvement is important.  But the embellishment of 
the country as a whole is equally important.  For this purpose we 
shall be setting up a new agency where various government 
entities would be brought together under one roof so that together 
they would give this aspect of the environment the importance it 
deserves.  
 
Our families deserve to live in an environment that enhances the 
quality of their life.  The time has come for a leap in quality in the 
upkeep and general look of various localities and public areas.  
 
Projects for the benefit of communities 
 
This programme of works includes the resurfacing of streets in 
Valletta, particularly in residential areas; a restoration and 
rehabilitation project at the lower end of Fort St Elmo; the 
rebuilding and paving of the promenade in Qajjenza; a public 
garden in the square in Triq l-Irmiġġ in Msida; sports facilities in 
84 
 
Kalkara and Xgħajra; the restoration of the lower parvis of the 
Church of St Catherine in Żejtun; and the development of a 
football pitch in the Family Park in Marsascala. 
 
Government is committed to the regeneration of Marsaxlokk.  
During 2016 a public consultation was held for residents to make 
suggestions as to how their village could be regenerated in the 
best possible way.  Work was also carried out on the repair and 
the embellishment of streets in the neighbourhood to improve 
accessibility and traffic circulation. 
 
A tendering process has also been set in motion for the 
construction of a new car park and works are forecast to take 
place in the first quarter of next year when the surrounding roads 
would also be completed.  Following that, works will commence on 
Xatt is-Sajjieda, turning this part of the village into a pedestrian 
zone.  
 
In collaboration with the Birżebbuġa Local Council, in 2017 we 
shall be formulating a plan for the regeneration of this locality. 
 
In Fgura we shall be carrying out an environmental and sports 
project which consists of a public garden in Triq Valperga where 
more trees will be planted and will include a walking and jogging 
track, a relaxation area, a sports pitch and a scouting area. The 
building of a BMX track close to this garden is also being planned. 
 
85 
 
We shall be allocating funds to the Żebbug Local Council for the 
building of a new Civic Centre. 
 
Works will also be carried out in Duminku Mintoff Garden in Paola, 
affording the residents more pleasant surroundings and modern 
facilities.  Similar works will be carried out at l-Għarusa tal-Mosta 
Garden. 
 
Another process that will be launched is the partial local plan 
review which will identify a site on public land, already committed 
as a development zone, for the building of an administrative centre 
outside Valletta. 
 
Incentives for community projects by businesses 
 
Businesses undertaking embellishment and useful projects for the 
benefit of local communities, that have the approval of the 
respective Local Council, will be given tax rebates.xvii 
 
The environment 
 
Today we are increasingly aware that the protection of the 
environment around us should be a priority. A healthy environment 
means a better quality of life. 
 
We firmly believe in our environmental credentials. These were 
confirmed by our decision to switch over to gas in the generation 
of electricity; the development of a modern infrastructure for waste 
86 
 
management; the regeneration of Natura 2000 sites; increasing 
the number of marine protected sites to fourteen; and the setting 
up of autonomous structures for the protection of the environment 
and our resources. 
 
Environment and Resources Authority 
 
With the setting up of the Environment and Resources Authority 
we now have an authority with responsibility in the environment 
sector. In 2017 this authority will embark on a number of projects, 
partially financed by the European Union, which include the 
monitoring of the maritime environment. 
 
Strengthening of legislation 
 
In 2017 we shall be setting up an Advisory Committee to 
strengthen legislation and enforcement with regards to the abusive 
dumping of waste.xviii xix 
 
Waste management 
 
Following the inauguration earlier this year of three new plants in 
Malta North in Magħtab, the autoclave in Marsa and the transfer 
station at tal-Kus in Gozo with an investment of around €65 million 
and the introduction of waste separation systems and the 
collection of organic waste in some localities, in 2017 we shall be 
extending the collection of this type of waste to other localities. 
 
87 
 
Meanwhile, we have to consider seriously alternatives to replace 
the landfill at Għallis when this reaches saturation point.  
 
Parks and afforestation 
 
2017 will see the continuation of various projects including the 
Buskett project; parks at Kennedy Grove and Salina; the 
restoration of fortifications and other areas surrounding Argotti 
Gardens; and the new park in Ħaż-Żabbar. In 2017 work on 
afforestation projects will be carried out on sites earmarked in 
Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq, Swatar, Msida, opposite Mater Dei Hospital, 
Wied Blandun and Cospicua.xx 
 
Tal-Inwadar National Park 
 
In the south of Malta we shall build the second largest national 
park after the Majjistral Park, which will extend from Ta' Barkat 
plant to Żonqor Point. For this purpose we shall appoint a Board of 
Governance to transform the area into an attractive park where the 
environment of our island can be better enjoyed.  
 
Argotti Gardens 
 
We shall be joining together the Argotti Gardens, the Garden of St 
Philip and the Mall and transform them into botanical gardens. The 
project is estimated to cost over €3 million.  Works on this project 
will be taken in hand during 2017. 
 
88 
 
Sustainable open spaces 
 
Whilst continuing to identify sites that could serve as public open 
spaces, we shall also manage and maintain sites of natural value 
and which are part of our national heritage such as the Victoria 
Lines, the Cottonera Lines and the area around Għar Lapsi. 
 
We believe that there is a need for more spaces where families 
could spend their leisure time. For this purpose we shall be 
investing in an upgrade of the picnic area at Ta' Qali. At the same 
time, we are in the process of identifying a location for a new 
camping site. 
 
Agriculture 
 
Thanks to new incentives for the production and promotion of high 
quality local agricultural produce under a programme of rural 
development, we shall be putting in place a framework for the 
certification and control of products to provide consumers with 
quality products that carry a warranty brand. 
 
In 2017 we shall once again establish an agricultural extension 
service offering technical advice and assistance to farmers and 
breeders on a regular basis. 
 
With regards to the relocation of cattle farms currently situated in 
residential areas or historical sites, an application was submitted 
for the building of modern farms that respect environmental 
89 
 
regulations and the closure of farms that are known to cause 
inconvenience. 
 
In 2017 the programme for the restructuring and upgrading of the 
public abattoir will continue. 
 
Transfer of agricultural land between family members 
 
In order to address the many requests for the transfer of farmland 
which are still pending, we shall be introducing legal provisions to 
facilitate the transfer of government-owned agricultural land 
between farmers, particularly between members of the same 
family. 
 
Assistance to young farmers 
 
Legal provisions will come into force to facilitate the transfer of 
government-owned agricultural land in favour of young farmers.  
The land in question will be offered to young farmers at a low rent 
for the first five years. 
 
Fisheries and aquaculture 
 
In the fisheries sector, landing sites will be upgraded in 2017, 
including the building of a permanent office in Marsaxlokk. 
 
A call for tenders for the building of a new breakwater for 
fishermen in Marsaxlokk will be issued as soon as environmental 
90 
 
assessments and other preparatory work for the granting of a 
development permit are finalised.  The existing breakwater will 
also be repaired and upgraded.  These works will be carried out in 
2017. 
 
With regards to aquaculture, we shall continue our research 
programme with particular emphasis on diversification towards 
species not taken from the wild as well as the development of live 
feed for use in hatcheries. 
 
A plan is also being developed for sustainable offshore 
aquaculture operations in order to regulate the sector and ensure 
the elimination of any negative impact on the environment. 
 
Planning and government 
 
Setting up of the Lands Authority 
 
In the coming year we shall transform the Lands Department into 
an autonomous authority with a structure that will respond more 
adequately to present-day requirements.xxi 
 
 
 
91 
 
Temporary emphytheuses 
 
People holding government property under the title of temporary 
emphytheusis, where the period of emphytheusis has expired or is 
about to expire,  will be given the opportunity to renew the title 
under the same conditions of the original emphytheusis, apart 
from the ground rent due, which would need to be re-evaluated.xxii 
 
Scheme regarding shops 
 
We shall once again operate the scheme for shops outside 
Valletta.  This scheme applies to government-owned shops which 
are leased or subject to emphyteusis. Under this scheme, the 
lessee, the holder of the emphytheusis or the third party operator 
will now benefit from a title of temporary emphytheuses of 45 
years, subject to certain terms and conditions. 
 
Fiscal incentives for the development of public car parks 
 
In the coming year the Planning Authority is expected to publish 
proposals regarding incentives to develop new public car parks, 
including open air car parks.  
 
Refund of expenses on restoration works 
 
With the aim of preserving our cultural and historical heritage, 
through the Planning Authority, in 2017 Government will contribute 
towards a share of expenses incurred by owners in the restoration 
92 
 
of façades of historical buildings.  Details of this scheme will be 
announced at a later date. 
 
Removal of capping on large projects 
 
It is now possible for development application fees for large 
projects to be paid in instalments over a period of time. The 
Authority will be completely removing the existing capping of €0.5 
million with respect to this arrangement.  
 
Gozo 
 
Mr Speaker, the people of Gozo are well aware that over the past 
three years the economic performance of their island has 
undergone enormous change. This success was due to the 
enthusiasm and genuine interest we have always shown in this 
island to promote initiatives generating economic activity on a 
scale never witnessed before by the Gozo community. 
 
Since we believe that tourism should continue to serve as the 
mainstay of the Gozitan economy, in this past year we have gone 
to great lengths to strengthen this sector.  I need only remind you 
of the Ċittadella project where we invested more than €14 million. 
 
As a result of our continued endeavours, unemployment in Gozo 
went down from around 750 in March 2013 to just slightly over 500 
in June of this year. During the same period we witnessed an 
93 
 
upsurge in the number of Gozitans who found employment in 
Gozo itself. 
 
We shall therefore keep working on these lines.  
 
Projects that gave Gozo a new dimension 
 
Projects that will give Gozo a new dimension and at the same 
continue to diversify the island’s economy, include the investments 
already agreed upon regarding the general hospital and the Barts 
medical school as well as the digital centre to be built in the 
Xewkija Industrial Zone. 
 
In order to reinforce the digital infrastructure of Gozo we are 
allocating a substantial investment of €3.2 million over the coming 
two years for the provision of a fibre optic link between Malta and 
Gozo which will further sustain this infrastructure.  This link should 
help in attracting more investment in the field of IT and in the 
digital economy which we wish to serve as a new niche economy 
on the island. 
 
In addition, to provide greater serenity for big investment decisions 
that we are succeeding in attracting to Gozo, we shall be doing 
away with dependence on a single fibre optic link and invest in a 
second fibre optic cable between the two islands.  
 
 
 
94 
 
Assistance to Gozitan students 
 
Besides continuing to assist Gozitan students who study in Malta, 
we shall be extending the subsidy we currently give to those who 
follow full-time courses at the University of Malta and MCAST to 
apply also to Gozitan students who attend any other private higher 
education institution in Malta. 
 
Public works in Gozo 
 
During the coming year we shall be starting work on a project for 
the setting up of a Gozo Museum which is estimated to cost 
around €5 million. 
 
We shall also be implementing something that the previous 
administration 
promised 
on 
several 
occasions 
but 
never 
accomplished.  Thanks to a partnership with the private sector, 
Gozo will finally have a new swimming pool which could also serve 
to attract sports tourism to the island.xxiii 
 
We shall continue with our project tin connection with the Gozo 
Law Courts so that the courts could move out of Ċittadella and 
start functioning from a modern complex. We shall adopt the same 
plan with regards to the Victoria Primary School, which will be 
transferred from a historical building to new premises, adequately 
furnished with modern amenities.  
 
95 
 
Other projects include the Home for the Elderly in Għajnsielem 
with an investment of €6 million and the project of a stairway which 
links the car park in the centre of Rabat to St Francis Square at a 
cost of €3 million. 
 
We shall also roll out a number of projects for the embellishment 
of main village squares; the cleaning of valleys, the rebuilding of 
rubble walls in various localities; and the restoration of historical 
sites including the Xewkija Mill and Calypso's Cave.xxiv 
 
In 2017 we intend to continue with a vast programme of works 
involving the resurfacing of various roads in Gozo that have been 
abandoned for a number of years. 
 
The Ċittadella project 
 
In 2017 we want to ensure the proper maintenance of this historic 
complex so that the Ċittadella would be enjoyed by future 
generations.xxv 
 
In the coming year we shall start a process of consultation with 
regards to the current parking situation in Victoria, a topic that has 
become even more pressing now that the Ċittadella has become a 
major attraction. 
 
 
 
96 
 
Improved connectivity between Gozo and Malta 
 
To enhance connectivity between Gozo and Malta we set the ball 
rolling with the issue of a Request For Proposals (RFP) for the 
launching of a fast ferry service between Valletta and Mġarr in 
Gozo. 
 
At the same time, substantial progress was registered on a 
permanent connection between the two islands.  Early in 2017, 
geological studies will be carried out so that on the strength of this 
information it will be possible to build a precise geological model of 
the seabed.xxvi 
 
In 2017 we shall also be working on the first phase of a public call 
to design, build and operate a sub seabed tunnel connecting the 
two islands. 
 
White paper concerning devolution regarding Gozo 
 
In 2017 we shall issue a white paper intended to set in motion a 
consultation process concerning the devolution of certain 
responsibilities for the island of Gozo.  Our aim is to promote a 
wide discussion regarding those administrative functions and other 
activities directly relating to Gozo and whether and to what extent 
it would be feasible for such matters to be entrusted to the 
management and direction of a body operating from Gozo itself.  
This forms part of a process of decentralisation which would at the 
same time give a stronger voice to Gozo. 
97 
 
                                                           
i In 2017 Enemalta will continue to invest in advanced technology which will be 
spread out across the 1,400 substations in Malta and Gozo to further improve 
the supply and distribution of electricity whilst continuing the fight against 
electricity theft which is now below 3% the lowest level ever registered in Malta 
and far below the European average.  
 
ii  The final study which also includes the design of the whole pipeline system 
and the Scoping Report to kickstart the process for the necessary 
environmental permits in Italy and Malta is expected to be completed in 2017.  
 
iii  The Energy and Water Agency has embarked on preparatory work to collect 
the necessary data in order to draw up an integrated plan regarding climate and 
energy for the period 2020-2030. 
 
iv  Following a call for tenders for the necessary works, applications will soon 
start to be considered under a scheme for those who would like to invest in this 
farm which will be in operation in 2017.  Enemalta is also considering the 
development of other solar farms in which the general public will be given the 
opportunity to invest. 
 
v  It is intended to launch a scheme backed by a feed-in-tariff for renewable 
energy installations, primarily photovoltaic installations larger than 1MW.  The 
sites will be chosen according to the Solar Farm Policy. 
 
vi  In the field of energy efficiency, the Energy and Water Agency will be looking 
at recommendations arising from an audit of energy efficiency carried out on a 
number of government buildings by Bosch following a Memorandum of 
Understanding between government and the company. 
 
vii  The promotion of energy audits will continue in 2017 and will be extended to 
all enterprises, in collaboration with Malta Enterprise and the Malta Business 
Bureau. 
 
viii  In 2017 the agency will be applying for European Union funds for the 
replacement of more than 2,000 conventional street lighting with energy saving 
LEDs. 
 
ix  The necessary studies are currently in hand to establish a set of benchmarks 
for each hotel. 
 
x  Following the approval by the European Union of funds for the development 
of solar schemes and in a bid to reach national targets for renewable energy, in 
the coming months Malita plc in partnership with Malta Government 
Investments Ltd will be floating solar bonds on the market which may be taken 
up by the general public. These bonds will finance the leasing of solar panel 
systems to be installed on commercial establishments so that enterprises 
investing in these systems would have an added source of financing.  The 
98 
 
                                                                                                                                              
bonds will also be used to finance solar systems in public areas that will be 
identified in the coming months. 
 
xi  These works are intended as compensation for the inconvenience borne by 
residents in the course of the project and will be financed by the Water Services 
Corporation. 
 
xii  We will keep honouring this pledge in 2017 when we shall be refunding all 
tax paid by those who registered vehicles in 2006.  This means that by the end 
of 2017 we would have paid back around €9.5 million collected in excess by the 
previous administration. 
 
xiii  This plan will include positive measures together with incentives which these 
entities are prepared to offer to their employees to commute to and from work 
using group transport rather than their own vehicles. The Planning Authority has 
already successfully adopted a similar plan which led to over 80 employees 
participating in this initiative. 
 
xiv  Records show that at present there are already around 5,000 persons who 
will turn 18 at some point next year and who already have the Tallinja card.  
These will be given a refund of the card. 
 
xv  This will cover refund of all capital expenses related to the use of bicycles, 
including the installation of showers. An allocation of €150,000 is being placed 
at the disposal of a board which will be set up and which will include 
representatives of organisations promoting the use of bicycles, to administer 
these funds. 
 
xvi  In this contest mention should be made of the solution based on temporary 
access that was found recently to ease the problem of congestion caused by 
traffic leaving Cottonera and neighbouring areas on its way to Valletta. We 
believe that whenever circumstances warrant this position and whenever 
feasible, the authorities responsible for traffic management should identify 
practical solutions, even short-term ones, to ease problems that might arise 
from time to time and implement them as a matter of urgency. 
 
xvii  This would be equivalent to 120% of the value of the works when the 
additional 20% does not exceed €15,000. 
 
xviii  The need is felt for stronger enforcement and harsher penalties for abusers, 
and legislative amendments in this sense will come into force next year with the 
ultimate goal of having a structure and dedicated system of prosecution of 
environmental offences such as are found in other countries.  
 
xix  At the same time we shall carry on with the necessary legal reforms relating 
to sustainable green public procurement and the enforcement of measures 
relating to the green economy.  
 
99 
 
                                                                                                                                              
xx   In this context, in 2017 we shall be investigating the possibility of 
embellishing the urban areas of our islands through innovative projects with the 
creation of so-called vertical gardens so that public spaces and buildings which 
are appropriate for such projects would be utilised and used as green spaces 
and buildings. Our intention is to also look into the possibility of operating this 
scheme in partnership with the private sector. 
 
xxi  The Authority will need to convert the present system of files to a digital 
format to ensure efficiency and transparency in the administrative process. The 
Authority will draw up a framework of standards regarding the valuations of 
property in a professional manner. 
 
xxii  This applies to holders of emphyteusis who operate the property themselves 
and hold the property subject to  ground rent in its entirety and where the 
property has not been divided and leased out or made the subject of sub-
emphytheusis to third parties, and is not being used as the ordinary residence 
which is covered by other legislation. 
 
xxiii   Following a Request For Proposals for the design, construction and 
maintenance of the complex by the private sector, it is expected that by the end 
of the year the contract for this project will be concluded. This should make it 
possible to start the works in 2017.  The project is expected to be completed in 
around a year and a half.  
 
xxiv   In the years ahead beaches in Gozo should be managed better. Priority will 
be given to Ħondoq ir-Rummien and to Marsalforn, two beaches that were 
awarded a Beach of Quality status during 2016 and that will be considered for 
the award of the Blue Flag in 2017. 
 
xxv  What was achieved through the restoration of the Ċittadella cannot be 
allowed to deteriorate but should be properly maintained. For this purpose we 
shall be studying the various options for projects that would be sustainable. 
 
xxvi   Agreement has been reached between the University of Malta and 
Transport Malta to carry out seismic testing in the coming weeks.

ENHANCING THE COUNTRY’S COMPETITIVENESS  
 
Mr Speaker, the investment announced in the past few months, 
originating from Jordan, Singapore, the United Kingdom, China, 
Qatar and the United States of America, clearly shows the good 
results being achieved by this Government in making the country 
competitive and attractive to foreign investors. This trend will 
continue in the years ahead because the Government believes 
that this country has a lot to offer. 
 
Malta Development Bank 
 
Our financial infrastructure will be strengthened considerably in 
2017 when the Malta Development Bank will start to operate.  
Through this Bank we shall have a new financial infrastructure that 
will specialise in the development of investment in our country.  
The Bank will have an authorised capital of €200 million, of which 
€30 million will be the initial paid up capital.i 
 
Setting up of an Export Credit Agency 
 
It is my pleasure to announce that work on the setting up of an 
Export Credit Agency is progressing as planned.ii 
 
 
101 
 
Fight against unjust competition - 
Setting up of the Joint Enforcement Task Force 
 
In the fight against unjust competition in commerce and against 
tax evasion, we are setting up the Joint Enforcement Task Force 
to ensure joint action by the Department of Inland Revenue, the 
VAT Department as well as the Customs Department.  The Tax 
Compliance Unit will also have an active role in this new initiative. 
 
The priorities of this Joint Enforcement Task Force will include 
control and more frequent spot checks on employers who recruit 
unregistered workers and on owners of rented property which is 
not declared with the authorities as well as a close watch for unjust 
competition from certain imported goods. 
 
European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI) 
 
The European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI) is an 
important instrument which could further spur our economic 
growth. 
 
Following the setting up of the Malta Development Bank, plans are 
now in hand for this Bank to be instrumental in acquiring funds 
also from the EFSI to create more investment opportunities.  
 
Government has already identified the Marsamxett breakwater 
project as a candidate for EFSI financing for the regeneration of 
Marsamxett harbour. 
102 
 
At the same time we are giving consideration to other initiatives 
that qualify within the scope of this Fund so as to make the best 
use of EFSI for our country’s benefit.   
 
IIP and the National Development and Social Fund 
 
During this year we shall continue to promote the successful 
Individual Investor Programme (IIP) which is attracting wealth and 
investment to our country.  The National Development and Social 
Fund, which administers a substantial part of the funds generated 
by this programme, will soon come into operation.  Access to 
these funds will be open to projects of national interest as well as 
pilot projects for Local Councils.  
 
International Accelerator 
 
With the aim of providing more professional assistance to local 
start-ups, we shall bring to the country an International 
Accelerator. This should help to establish new economic niches, 
particularly in the field of new technologies, and to attract 
international operators with access to networks of entrepreneurs 
who could help Maltese start-ups to widen their operations. 
 
 
103 
 
European Funds 
 
The European funds Malta has carefully absorbed since its 
accession to the European Union contributed significantly towards 
the building of a modern country, the promotion of wealth and the 
reinforcement of various sectors of our infrastructure, including 
education, ICT, employment, culture, tourism, renewable energy, 
health, fisheries and migration. In 2017, we shall be doing our 
utmost to improve the rate at which we absorb EU funds allocated 
for 2014-2020. 
 
In this context I would like to recall the extensive commitment we 
will be taking up in the first six months of 2017 when we shall be 
responsible for the Presidency of the European Council.  This will 
be a historic occasion for our country and the Government is well 
prepared for this responsibility. 
 
Our priorities include immigration, relations between the Union and 
our Mediterranean neighbours, maritime issues particularly 
transport and tourism, and the development of a common single 
market with particular reference to SMEs.  Of special interest to us 
are the social dimension, financial and monetary policies, 
international trade, research and innovation together with a digital 
strategy and energy.  
 
We are certain that after all the hard work and painstaking 
preparations during the last months with respect to a draft national 
104 
 
programme for the Maltese Presidency as well as all the 
preparatory work for the meetings of the European Union Council 
and other high level meetings to be held during the term of the 
Maltese Presidency, we will succeed in holding high the name of 
Malta. 
 
We believe that all good-willed people will agree with this and are 
prepared to extend their full support so that the Government and 
the Maltese people will face this challenge with dignity. 
 
The year 2017 will also witness the relaunch of MEUSAC so that 
this Committee will strengthen its relevance in the country’s 
Europeanization process. 
 
Financial Services 
 
From the very start, we recognised that financial services and 
international trade constitute a central plank of the Maltese 
economy. These sectors provide high quality jobs and generate 
revenue for the country through taxation, foreign investment, lease 
of property, purchase of products and services, etc.   
 
We remain committed to lending support to these sectors, above 
all, through our insistence on Malta’s right to continue to offer a 
competitive taxation whilst respecting international standards of 
transparency and exchange of information. 
 
105 
 
Thus, we shall continue to insist on and defend the Maltese 
system of taxation in the light of international developments whilst 
at the same time continuing to ensure that our tax regime is 
constantly up to date with the latest developments. 
 
For this purpose, we intend to introduce new measures meant to 
promote more foreign investment in our country, such as a system 
which accords the same benefits to capital investment as it does 
to loans and the introduction of detailed Tax Consolidation 
regulations that permit groups of companies to calculate their profit 
and loss on a group basis.  We also intend to invest in the further 
improvement of the taxation regime which constitutes one of the 
main elements that attracts foreign investment to our islands. 
 
Government has continued to consolidate Financial Services in 
Malta with the setting up of the Resolution Authority and the Office 
of the Arbiter for Financial Services.  
 
We shall also continue to develop a legislative framework to 
regulate new sectors and processes in the field of insurance, 
collective investment funds and securitisation to ensure that the 
Maltese financial sector continues to grow in a dynamic manner.  
 
 
106 
 
Encouraging investment on the Malta Stock Exchange 
 
Government will be extending incentives so that more persons will 
invest their funds on the Malta Stock Exchange whilst encouraging 
more enterprises to access credit provided through the Exchange. 
 
For this purpose, in 2017 we shall be giving new fiscal incentives, 
in the form of a Risk Investment Scheme, this time for those 
investing capital  in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) or in an 
investment fund spread over a number of SMEs registered on an 
alternative trading platform such as Prospects on the Malta Stock 
Exchange.  Individuals who invest in this manner will be receiving 
a tax credit up to a maximum of €250,000 per year. 
 
Moreover, 
we shall also be giving fiscal incentives to 
entrepreneurs who float shares in their companies for public 
investment through the Malta Stock Exchange.  To date, earnings 
on capital derived from shares prior to listing on the principal 
exchange are taxed at 15%.  These gains will now be exempt from 
tax. 
 
This incentive will also apply to entrepreneurs who list on the 
alternative trading platform.iii 
 
We 
are 
introducing 
these 
incentives 
as 
a 
concrete 
acknowledgement of the risk and initiative on the part of the 
original promoters. 
107 
 
These measures will complement a number of other initiatives that 
are due to be introduced by the Malta Stock Exchange.   
 
Incentives for employers to set up private pensions 
 
In last year's budget speech I referred to the setting up of a 
working group to consider fiscal benefits for employers linked to 
voluntary private pension plans at the work place. 
 
After this working group submitted its recommendations, I am now 
in a position to announce a set of measures that we shall offer as 
from 2017 to employers who, on a voluntary basis, decide to offer 
a private pension to their employees.  
 
The Government will give fiscal incentives in the form of tax credit 
to companies that invest in pension schemes on behalf of their 
workers.iv  
 
Maritime hub 
 
The project to transform the industrial site formerly occupied by 
the Marsa shipbuilding yard into a hub for the oil and gas industry 
and for logistics, will be pushed forward in 2017 after an 
agreement signed with Ablecare Oilfield Services Holdings Limited 
which will invest around €55 million over a span of ten years.v 
 
 
 
108 
 
Amongst other activities, this hub will provide facilities for the 
repair and recertification of oil rigs; storage for machinery and 
facility logistics; and logistics and assistance to companies 
engaged in oil drilling. 
 
Free trade zone and international logistics hub 
 
We are committed to placing Malta on the map as an international 
logistics hub through an expansion of the nature and volume of 
activities in free trade zones. 
 
In order to exploit Malta's potential as an international logistics 
base, during 2016 action was taken in hand on a plan so that by 
means of a Public Private Partnership, an international logistics 
centre of over 40,000 square meters will be developed at Ħal-Far 
with an investment of €80 million.  This plan will be further 
implemented during 2017 when an authority will be set up to 
govern and regulate all activities in the new hubs that will be 
declared free trade zones.vi 
 
Maritime Malta 
 
Through the Maritime Proof of Concept Fund we shall encourage 
academics and students with creative and innovative ideas to 
secure the necessary financial support for the development of their 
ideas in the field of maritime trade into business concepts.vii 
 
 
109 
 
Property Malta 
 
Together with the Malta Developers Association (MDA) we shall 
be setting up an entity to be styled Property Malta to act as 
catalyst to encourage foreigners to take up residence and invest in 
our islands.  The aim is for Property Malta to participate in 
international promotional and advertising activities to attract 
investors and people who would like to purchase holiday homes to 
settle in Malta.  
 
The Life Sciences Park 
 
There are strong prospects that in the coming months there will be 
a substantial increase in the number of companies operating from 
the Life Sciences Park following an intensive drive by Malta 
Enterprise to attract more investment in the fields of research and 
innovation. viii  With the aim of strengthening this sector, the 
National Skills Council will be evaluating the skills set and human 
resources needed in the field research and development.  
 
The gaming sector 
 
In the coming year the Gaming Authority will be drawing up a 
regulatory framework that identifies the requirements of the 
industry and that will enable the Authority to have the means and 
powers that are necessary to fulfil its aims and obligations under 
the law.  
110 
 
Moreover, this legislative framework will address gaming 
regulation in a way that will not stifle innovation in the sector whilst 
continuing to enhance the protection of consumers and to 
emphasize responsible gaming.ix  
 
Digital Economy 
 
Through the National Digital Strategy - Digital Malta, we are 
fulfilling our vision of strengthening the country through the use of 
technology in all aspects of society. 
 
To accomplish the country's digital agenda we shall continue to 
strengthen the Government network and data centres, rendering 
this network more efficient and capable of offering more business 
continuity. 
 
We also need to bolster our position with regards to risks posed by 
information technology and for this purpose we shall be launching 
a strategy for Cyber Security while in the years ahead we shall 
focus on its implementation. 
 
Communications 
 
The communications sector is the backbone of a strong digital 
economy and is fundamental to the ICT industry in Malta.  We are 
committed to continue to support development in the field of 
electronic communications and ICT.x 
 
111 
 
In order to establish our country among the leading WiFi states in 
the world, we shall continue to increase the distribution of 
hotspots. 
 
We shall also continue to work on the project to ensure greater 
international connectivity by means of a new submarine cable 
between Malta and Marseille in France and shall evaluate the 
possibility of financial aid from the European Union.  The aim of 
the project is to provide a wider and more efficient choice.  
 
Ta' Qali Crafts Village 
 
We shall benefit from EU funds so that we will finally be able to 
implement the Ta’ Qali Crafts Village project at a cost of around 
€14 million.  This project too will take off in 2017.xi 
 
Xewkija Industrial Estate 
 
We shall extend the Xewkija Industrial Zone to cater for two 
different lines of activity with an investment of €16 million for new 
business workshops as well as for financial services, ICT, 
research and training.xii 
 
Food manufacturing centre at Mrieħel 
 
We are also working on a project to convert the site formerly 
occupied by the Dowty plant in Mrieħel into a food manufacturing 
centre.xiii 
112 
 
New schemes to assist business  
 
Malta Enterprise will be launching several new business oriented 
schemes.  This includes a scheme offering financial assistance to 
disadvantaged individuals to help them set up sustainable 
businesses with the level of assistance reaching up to as much as 
€25,000 for each start-up.xiv Under a scheme of fiscal credit on 
research projects, assistance would vary between 25 and 45 per 
cent of the outlay. 
 
Under a scheme for the development of digital gaming with a 
cultural theme, assistance would be given in the form of fiscal 
credit up to a maximum of 30 per cent of costs linked to the 
development of digital games. 
 
Reduction of planning fees for industry 
 
As of next year the Planning Authority will reduce planning fees 
related to projects and industrial development in industrial zones 
so that these tariffs would replace existing commercial tariffs.  
 
Less bureaucracy in opening a businessxv 
 
In order to reduce the time needed to open a business from 30 to 
3 days, as of 1st January 2017 shops and other commercial 
premises will no longer require a trading licence to operate a 
commercial activity.  Through this measure, businesses will 
collectively save over €1.3 million annually. 
113 
 
Changes in shopping hours 
 
We shall introduce changes in the opening hours of shops and 
other commercial establishments so as to strike a balance 
between commercial interests, the needs of the public and 
protection of the employees concerned.xvi      
 
Fair trading with less bureaucracy 
 
We are committed to facilitate fair trading. At the same time we 
need to ensure that the necessary controls are in place to guard 
against all types of illicit and illegal activity - and we shall continue 
to do this by means of additional enforcement action by the 
Customs Department. 
 
Following the removal of the need of a bank guarantee as a 
requisite for payments by cheque, in order to continue to reduce 
bureaucracy, we shall be launching an electronic payment system 
as well as an online payment system in 2017. 
 
Less bureaucracy for small start-ups  
 
Government wishes to encourage more young graduates to enter 
the world of business.  We are therefore proposing that youths 
who graduated from post-secondary institutions over the past 
three years and who set up companies with an annual turnover of 
less than €80,000 will be entitled to exemption from audit in the 
first two years or else, should they elect to go for audit, to receive 
114 
 
a tax rebate of 120% on audit costs up to a maximum of €700 per 
year.       
 
Public Private Partnerships 
 
In 2017, Projects Malta will make sure that projects on which 
agreement was reached between the Government and private 
interests will develop in accordance with agreed parameters.  
These include the investment in St Luke's Hospital, Karen Grech 
Hospital and the Gozo General Hospital with works on St Luke's 
Hospital expected to commence this year whilst works in Gozo are 
expected to start early in 2017.  
 
There is also the development of maritime transport that will 
connect the main arteries with Valletta in a sustainable manner. 
 
Following a Memorandum of Understanding between Government 
and Huawei, a Joint Innovation Centre will be set up between the 
University of Malta and Huawei for the development of IT 
applications. 
 
Projects Malta will address the problem of lack of parking facilities 
in various areas including Mosta, Wied il-Għajn, Birkirkara, St. 
Andrews and Birgu.  
 
 
115 
 
In the coming months, Projects Malta will consider the feasibility of 
issuing a public call for the conversion of the former naval hospital 
in Imtarfa into an international independent school offering courses 
leading to an International Baccalaureate. 
 
In 2017, the Public Private Partnership between Government and 
the Royal Malta Yacht Club will implement measures to promote 
the yachting sector and will assess the economic impact of the 
Rolex Middle Sea Race with the intention of attracting similar 
races.  
 
At this point I would like to mention that after having successfully 
attracted private and foreign investment for the development of 
new yacht marina facilities at Sa Maison, in 2017 will shall renew 
our efforts to attract more investment in this sector.  We shall issue 
a call for tenders for a new project in Gzira Gardens whilst also 
considering the development of a yacht marina in Marsascala. 
 
In 2017 TradeMalta, a Public Private Partnership  between 
Projects Malta and the Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise and 
Industry, will continue to assist Maltese companies in the export of 
products and services through business visits  to foreign markets 
including the Middle East, the Gulf States and Russia and 
business fora and seminars with a focus on particular markets 
such as the United States.  
 
116 
 
Last March the Mrieħel Enterprise Zone Foundation was set up 
between the Government and 18 private companies, tasked with 
the upkeep of the Mrieħel Industrial Zone.xvii 
 
Tourism 
 
Growth in the number of tourist arrivals is important and we 
believe that the record number of 1.9 million arrivals expected by 
the end of 2016 can be improved upon and increased to 2 million 
in 2017.  At the same time, higher value added generated through 
activities in this sector and a sustained improvement in the quality 
of our tourism product, are also important goals.    
 
The work programme, initiatives and projects envisaged for next 
year should go a long way towards reaching these goals. 
 
In this sector, through Malta Enterprise, assistance will be given 
on expenses related to renovation works on hotels and restaurants 
- this would be in the form of tax credits relating to renovation 
expenses, up to a maximum of €50,000 for restaurants and 
€200,000 for hotels. 
 
Under another scheme fiscal assistance will be given in order to 
encourage local restaurants to engage chefs with international 
experience on a temporary basis: this assistance will reach a 
maximum of €10,000. 
 
117 
 
Air Malta 
 
One of the biggest challenges we inherited in 2013 was Air Malta 
where we found an airline that was running losses of millions of 
euro every year. Despite a restructuring plan agreed with the 
European Union to save the national airline, we still encountered 
several dark clouds on the horizon. 
 
Our strategic plan for Air Malta is based on awareness that, in an 
industry where airlines are consolidating, Air Malta cannot 
continue to compete as a standalone airline with a fleet of eight to 
ten aircraft. We acknowledge therefore the need to  form part of a 
larger organisation that would give us an advantage in terms of 
aircraft leasing, fuel purchase, IT systems , etc. 
 
All options are still open and Government will only agree to a plan 
that is advantageous for Air Malta and for the country. 
 
Overseas advertising strategy 
 
In the opinion of the authorities responsible for our tourism 
industry, the advertising tools we have used and are still using in 
promoting our islands abroad have not always kept pace with the 
needs of international tourism markets that are constantly 
changing.  
 
For this reason, we need to promote our islands not only by the 
use of more modern and more convincing tools to appeal to the 
118 
 
various cultures and tastes of tourists from many different 
countries.  We also need to make more effective use of 
contemporary means of digital communication which today play an 
important role to better position a country as a tourist destination.  
 
Strategy for Comino 
 
If we really wish to preserve the distinct value that our tourism 
product derives from Comino, we must without any further delay 
address the challenges brought about mainly by the small size of 
this island and the ever increasing number of daily visitors which in 
July and August reaches up to some 5,000 persons.  
 
Against this background, next year we shall reform the 
organisation of tourist activities on this island and the surrounding 
sea, in the context of  a national plan for the preservation of the 
natural environment of the Maltese Islands.  
 
After discussions with stakeholders, we plan to set up a working 
committee led by the Ministry of Tourism and that will include 
representatives of various entities and ministries so that for the 
first time, we can work together so that Comino will be given the 
status of a National Park.  The committee would also oversee the 
implementation the Natura 2000 Management Plan for the island 
of Comino. xviii 
 
 
119 
 
Institute of Tourism Studies 
 
On the strength of an agreement with various local and 
international institutions, 2016 witnessed the launching of a 
process whereby, as of September 2017, students would be able 
to attend courses offered by the Institute in collaboration with 
these institutions that would lead to honours bachelor degrees.  
 
A lot of work also took place in connection with the launching of a 
scheme in 2017 in collaboration with foreign entities so that skills 
acquired throughout the years by persons engaged in the field of 
hospitality and tourism will be validated.  This would allow these 
workers to acquire accreditation certificates and make it possible 
for them to advance in their careers or further their studies at a 
higher level.  
 
Contribution by tourists 
 
Following the introduction in 2016 of a tourist contribution of 50 
cents for every night spent in our country, a trust will now be set 
up, consisting of government representatives and private interests, 
and tasked with identifying projects that could be financed through 
these contributions.  These projects will be implemented by this 
new agency which will be responsible for the general upkeep of 
the Maltese Islands and also administer these funds.  
 
In this way the private sector would be allowed a bigger role in the 
management and embellishment of the country. 
120 
 
The conference sector 
 
For the conference sector to remain a steady source of income to 
the economy, in 2017 we shall continue to implement an extensive 
project to upgrade services and facilities at the Mediterranean 
Conference Centre whilst at the same time endeavouring to 
generate new income streams.  
 
Greater accessibility to our beaches and upgrading of the 
coastal product 
 
The Ministry of Tourism, the Foundation for Tourism Zones and 
Project Malta will jointly launch competitive processes so that 
private interests will enter into partnerships with Government for 
the provision of improved access to beaches through reversible 
interventions that leave no negative impact. 
 
There will also be better management of our bays; a higher level 
of security in prominent tourism zones the upgrading of sanitary 
facilities; and a drive to ensure that standards of general 
cleanliness in the country will be given attention.  
 
Incentives for the film industry 
 
The Ministry of Tourism and the Film Commission are working to 
improve the incentive package for film production and to attract 
more international production houses to film in Malta.   This also 
121 
 
serves to market our country as a tourist destination in what is 
known as screen tourism. 
 
We shall introduce other changes in the Malta Film Fund to make 
it more effective and to give added impetus to our indigenous film 
industry. 
 
Justice Reforms 
 
Mr Speaker, as I have already mentioned, the organisation of a 
country’s legal system is today regarded as a very important 
benchmark in the rating of the extent to which it is prepared to 
attract and to welcome investment. We fully acknowledge the 
importance of this benchmark.   
 
Both because of this consideration as well as the fact that we want 
to ensure that our country functions within the rule of law 
according to a set of laws that respect the basic rights of every 
individual, we remain committed to carry on with the reform in the 
justice system that we embarked upon in the last three years. 
 
The aim of the reform is clear; every citizen has the right to obtain 
a service from the courts that is just and that is seen and felt to be 
just, in a prompt manner and without undue delay. Our commercial 
community too has the right to a prompt resolution of conflicts that 
may arise from time to time.  
 
122 
 
The long list of  reforms we have already carried out, even in the 
sphere of constitutional law, have led to better quality and to a 
marked swiftness in judicial proceedings and have strengthened 
the judiciary.  However, more remains to be done. 
 
In 2017 we shall be working on these main measures: 
 
 emphasize the need for more prosecutions to be led by the 
Office of the Attorney General rather the Police Corps; 
 set up an electronic register of companies and/or individuals 
declared insolvent; 
 further strengthen mediation as an alternative method of 
conflict resolution; and  
 add to the list of judicial acts that may be filed online. 
 
In 2017 we shall furnish three new additional courtrooms in the 
Law Courts building bringing up the number of courtrooms to 27 
and adding other infrastructural facilities such as a library and a 
new training room. 
 
We shall seriously consider whether the time is ripe for our country 
to once again have a commercial section within the Civil Court. 
 
We shall continue to strengthen the Legal Aid Agency and honour 
our pledge to appoint a permanent judge to serve in the Gozo 
Court. 
 
123 
 
We shall increase resources and upgrade existing facilities in the 
Family Court. 
 
In 2017 we shall also extend the pilot project for a new 
computerised system in criminal proceedings. 
 
Local Councils 
 
For Local Councils to have additional resources at their disposal, 
we remain committed to pass on to these Councils all the funds 
that would have been spent if elections were to be held in 2017.  
For this purpose we are proposing that, in the medium term, the 
annual allocations made available to Local Councils should reflect 
savings as a result of the fact that these elections will not be held. 
 
Urban Improvement Fund and CPPS 
 
The Planning Authority will be placing funds in a dedicated fund, to 
be known as the Planning Fund, at the disposal of Local Councils 
to be used in regional areas where it is planned to carry out 
initiatives shared by several Councils. Persons, entities and Local 
Councils may apply for these funds for the embellishment of any 
locality and the Authority would finance up to 70 per cent of 
infrastructural costs. 
 
 
124 
 
Local enforcement 
 
The fact that we now have one central entity that regulates local 
enforcement – the Local Enforcement System Agency (LESA) – 
has led to a greater measure of care and attention in local 
enforcement management.  
 
In 2017 LESA will further sustain its campaign in favour of driver 
training and improved standards of driving on our roads. The 
Agency will also act on the reform of penalties applicable for traffic 
law infringements in the sense that, in case of minor 
contraventions for one time only, a warning ticket would be issued 
instead of a fine. At the same time LESA will give greater attention 
to the enforcement of environmental regulations.  
 
We shall step up our fight against drunk driving and enforce more 
discipline on drivers across the country.  Following consultation we 
shall introduce a points system applicable for all drivers, while 
putting in place harsher penalties for drunk driving. 
 
Monitoring of party financing 
 
Following the adoption of party financing legislation as part of the 
monitoring process, in 2017 a professional audit firm will be 
commissioned, in an independent  manner,  to scrutinise 
donations made to political parties. 
 
 
125 
 
Transparency in the appointment of authorities 
 
Following radical changes we have already made for stronger 
forms of good governance, this year we shall be piloting another 
law that would put in place more scrutiny over the appointment of 
chairpersons of major authorities and ambassadors with the full 
involvement of this Parliament. 
 
Industrial relations 
 
After discussions with the social partners represented on the 
Industrial Relations Board, important amendments regarding 
labour legislation will come into force in the course of 2017.  
 
2017 will be a year in which the Department of Labour, apart from 
continuing its fight against precarious work, will start making use of 
an updated electronic system, which is in the process of being 
developed, by means of which random inspections of places of 
work could be carried out more swiftly and efficiently. 
 
In the context of the proposal of equal pay for equal work, in 2017 
we shall launch wide-ranging consultations with all stakeholders 
involved, including those engaged in temporary work agencies, to 
collect complete data regarding the full implications of such a step 
which would place wages and working conditions of employees 
engaged by sub-contractors on the same level as those of regular 
workers at the same place of work.  
126 
 
Sick leave 
 
Government will launch a consultation process on the proposal 
whereby parents will be able to benefit from sick leave entitlement 
when their children are sick. 
 
Financial assistance in case of fatal or grievous accident in 
the workplace 
 
In this context, I would like to recall our commitment to evaluate 
the possibility of the introduction of some form of insurance 
protection both for members of all discipline corps as well as other 
Government employees. 
 
This measure will be put in place during 2017 and will apply to all 
employees in the public service. 
 
Whilst Government will ensure that all its employees are provided 
with protective clothing, and are given proper training, appropriate 
to their job, in the unfortunate case where an employee, in the line 
of duty, suffers personal injury leading to permanent disability 
which would prevent any further gainful occupation or in the event 
of loss of life, Government will provide financial assistance to the 
employee or to the heirs, without the need to resort to legal action. 
 
Details of this new measure will be made available to all public 
service employees in 2017.  
 
127 
 
New legislation in 2017 
 
Next year we shall be moving legislative bills relating to 
cohabitation and the prohibition of conversion therapy. 
 
Donation of blood by gay donors  
 
In 2017 we shall make a further step towards a society that truly 
and really respects the sexual orientation of LGBTI persons when 
we shall launch a process of consultation regarding blood 
donations by homosexual persons. 
 
Vote at 16 
 
After extending the right to vote to young people aged 16 in 
elections for Local Councils and Administrative Committees, the 
next step is to hold a consultation process to analyse with an open 
mind the extension of this right to European Parliament elections 
and national general elections.  
 
Voluntary work 
 
In the field of voluntary work, through legislative amendments, we 
intend to further support this sector whilst at the same time 
introducing greater transparency and accountability.  
 
In collaboration with the Malta Council for the Voluntary Sector, 
two centres were set up, one in Valletta and another one in 
128 
 
Qawra.  In the beginning of 2017 two more centres will be opened, 
one in Rabat and another one in Marsaxlokk. 
 
To further sustain and encourage voluntary work, we shall extend 
the stipend scheme for young persons who engage in voluntary 
work abroad. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
i  It should be noted in this regard that after an evaluation of the loan operations 
that the Bank proposed to undertake, the capital resources and funds to be 
used to finance loans, the guarantee that would be extended by the 
Government to the Bank as well as the arrangements regarding governance 
and autonomy that Government was proposing for the Bank, Eurostat approved 
that the Bank would not be feature as part of the general Government and 
would not feature in public finances and government debt. 
 
ii  Much preparatory work has already been carried out on this proposal and 
consultations were held with banks operating in trade finance to ensure their 
backing and interest in an export credit scheme. 
 
iii  The higher the percentage of shares offered to the public, the higher would 
be the rebate on capital gains tax. 
129 
 
                                                                                                                                              
iv The total investment in a private pension by a company will be considered as 
recurrent expenditure for the purpose of tax computation for that company. 
 Furthermore, the company will be allowed an additional tax credit of €150 for 
every €1,000 invested on behalf of its employees.  This means in effect that for 
every €1,000 invested by a company on each employee, the financial impact on 
the company will amount to €500. 
 
In order to allow an opportunity also to self-employed workers and to employers 
in small-scale enterprises to enrol their employees in their private pension 
schemes, we shall amend the rules on private pensions so as to make it 
possible for associations that represent specific business sectors to administer 
these collective pensions schemes on behalf of the employees of their 
members and small enterprises will benefit from the fiscal incentives mentioned 
above.  
 
In addition, from an employee’s perspective, this investment on his behalf by his 
employer will not be considered as a fringe benefit and, consequently, the 
employee will not be required to pay tax on this amount. 
 
At the same time an employee will be allowed the possibility to invest in this 
scheme and upon doing so, will be allowed a tax rebate up to a maximum of 
€150 per year, according to the investment made.  The incentive in the form of 
tax deduction linked to the Third Pillar Pension scheme will also continue to 
apply. 
 
This means that in a traditional family where both the wife and the husband are 
in employment and both invest in a private pension scheme at their place of 
work as well as in the Third Pillar Pension, as a family  they would benefit from 
a tax saving of up to a maximum of €1,100 per year. 
The Government will consult with the social partners and with those involved in 
this sector on the introduction of this measure.  
 
v  After reaching agreement with Ablecare Oilfield Services Holdings Limited for 
the development of a maritime hub on the site of the former Marsa Shipbuilding 
site, in 2017 this major company in the oil and gas exploration sector will be 
implementing its plan to invest more than €50 million in this project. 
  
vi  As a first step to exploit  our  potential as an international logistics base, a 
public private partnership plan was drawn up for the development of an 
international logistics hub on a site of around 40,000m2 in Ħal Far with a total 
investment of €80 million.  Thanks to this project, it is also planned to provide a 
significant improvement in groupage facilities in this site. 
 
vii  This fund, that will not exceed €100,000, is intended to help bridge the gap 
between lab studies and market development and provide financial support to 
researchers and entrepreneurs.  
 
130 
 
                                                                                                                                              
viii  To date, Malta Enterprise has approved the allocation to more than 27 
companies of over 6,000m2 of space in the Life Sciences Park.  In 2017, Malta 
Enterprise will continue with its endeavours to attract more investment to the 
country in the field of research and development and there are good prospects 
that more companies will commence operations in this site. 
  
ix  Although the gaming sector in Malta is the second most important component 
of the Maltese economy, the Authority recognizes that the industry is not finding 
enough personnel with the required skills.  With this in mind the Authority has 
felt the need of an academy or institute offering training in the necessary skills 
to persons wishing to work in this industry.  For this purpose the European 
Gaming Institute of Malta will be set up to ensure high level training that would 
be recognised by the industry. 
 
x  it is estimated that in the first six months of 2016  the ICT sector in Malta  
contributed around 6.1% of all value added in the economy. 
 
xi  As part of this project, around 50 enterprises will be given assistance whilst it 
is expected that these expansions will create around 20 new jobs. In the coming 
months a call for tenders will be issued for works on this project.  
 
xii  In this project, vacant space in the Xewkija industrial zone known as il-Ħofra 
will be developed to house 15 new business workshops over a total area of 
5,400m2  for industrial activity whilst on a section of the site currently occupied 
by Malta Dairy Products a multi-purpose facility will be built to accommodate 
operations such as financial services, ICT, research and training, amongst other 
sectors.  In all, around 25 enterprises are expected to benefit from this project, 
together creating around 150 new jobs.  
 
xiii  Now that the steel structure formerly housing the Dowty plant has been 
dismantled and work has been taken in hand to convert this site into a food 
manufacturing centre, a number of major companies in the sector have agreed 
to move to this zone over the coming months.  
 
xiv It is believed that such a scheme would affect between 5 and 10 individuals.  
 
xv  The time required to establish a new business will be shortened to 3 days as 
of 1st January 2017.  As from that date, shops and other commercial premises 
formerly requiring a trading licence under Subsidiary Legislation 441.07 will no 
longer need a licence to carry out their commercial activities. This shall also 
apply to those requiring a trading licence to carry out commercial activities in 
the premises of clients, in other words not from commercial premises.  Thanks 
to this measure, businesses will collectively save more than €1.3 million per 
year.  At the same time, all those who would like to open a new business will 
henceforth be only required to fill an online application. 
 
 
131 
 
                                                                                                                                              
xvi Following wide public consultation, Government will implement changes in 
the opening hours of shops and other commercial premises.  Whilst those 
already entitled to open on Sundays and public holidays will retain this right, 
other commercial premises will be allowed to open on Sundays whilst choosing 
another day of the week during which they would be obliged to remain closed 
for business.  In this way a fair balance was found between commercial 
interests, the needs of consumers and protection of the employees concerned.  
 
At the same time, as a new service to business and consumers, the Department 
of Trade will keep a register of business and their respective opening hours. 
This information would be available to the public by means of an app which 
would not only locate commercial premises on a Google map but would also 
give information about their opening hours. 
 
xvii  In the context of a Masterplan aimed at upgrading this zone, in 2017 the 
Foundation will be taking in hand the branding of Mrieħel as a central business 
district and finding solutions for parking problems.  The Foundation will also 
identify ways of financing the development of main roads and the repair of other 
roads in the area, including the conversion to eco-friendly lighting. 
 
xviii  All operators in Comino must operate within the set of agreed parameters.  
In order to ensure that all those involved will give their share and observe the 
agreement, it is planned to appoint a small number of environmental rangers. 
 
After carrying out the necessary studies, we need to establish the island’s 
carrying capacty without losing its charm and attraction.  We also need to 
carefully manage visitor arrivals. We also need to introduce new and more 
efficient arrangements for the collection of environmental contributions that 
would underpin the management of the island. 
132 
 
HEALTH, SPORT AND CULTURE 
 
Our priorities in the health sector throughout this legislature are 
aimed at a reduction of waiting lists for operations and in 
emergencies; action on the problem of bed shortage, and a 
solution for out of stock medicines. 
 
We have achieved these objectives successfully while we 
continued to improve access to and the quality of health services 
in all departments. 
 
We also endeavoured to open the way for private investment by 
means of initiatives with investors that should lead to renewal and 
increased levels of sustainability in several areas of the national 
health service.  I refer to the strong investment of €200 million in 
the Gozo General Hospital, St Luke's Hospital and Karin Grech 
Hospital. 
 
We also promoted several public private partnerships so that, in 
collaboration with the private sector, we can offer a more efficient 
service. 
 
At the same time direct private investment is taking place that 
complements our initiatives.  
 
Our main goals for 2017 are to bring the health service closer to 
citizens while continuing to improve the quality of services on offer. 
 
133 
 
I refer to our tasks for 2017. 
 
Primary care 
 
In order to expand primary care further, in 2017 we shall start 
works on the regional hub on the site formerly occupied by the 
Pace Grasso Ground in Paola and proceed with our upgrading 
programme in other health centres. In 2017 we shall be kick 
starting another project that will lead to a new health centre in Ħal-
Kirkop. 
 
A new specialised mother and child hospital  
 
We shall also commence the necessary preliminary work that will 
lead to the setting up of a new specialised mother and child 
hospital in the coming years.i 
 
Pharmacy of Your Choice Scheme 
 
Under the Pharmacy of Your Choice Scheme, the pilot project for 
the home delivery of medicines to patients who are over 70 years 
or who have mobility problems will be expanded in 2017 to include 
other localities. 
 
In 2017 we shall also undertake to transport to patients in their 
own homes facilities and equipment for treatment that are too 
heavy or cumbersome for them to take directly to their dwellings.   
 
134 
 
Mental health 
 
We shall be looking at a model for the operation of a public private 
partnership in the field of mental health care that will lead towards 
improvements at Mount Carmel Hospital and a new hospital for 
acute psychiatric treatment. 
 
By working jointly with NGOs, we shall continue to strengthen 
community support even in mental health care with the aim of 
increasing the range of services closer to citizens.  
 
Mater Dei Hospital 
 
Another investment programme in medical equipment will be 
launched at Mater Dei Hospital so that this hospital will provide a 
more efficient quality service to the public. 
 
After having successfully addressed waiting lists for surgical 
interventions, including hip and knee replacement, it is intended in 
2017 to tackle vigorously other waiting lists, particularly in the 
outpatients department and in theatres.  
 
We shall also commence works on the project for the extension of 
the car park. 
 
 
135 
 
The fight against diabetes  
 
In order to address the problem of diabetes, we shall continue to 
introduce new medicines in the government formulary list and 
introduce new types of insulin. Glucose sticks will also be given 
free to patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.  
 
After the benefits to diabetic patients were curtailed by the 
previous administration in 2012, we shall introduce more benefits 
for these persons in 2017.  Diabetic patients who are yellow card 
holders will start to benefit from free dental treatment; subsidies on 
spectacles; access to free antibiotics; as well as treatment for 
blood sugar levels.  
 
This means the introduction of a more equitable system. 
 
The fight against cancer 
 
The goal of our second plan against cancer up to 2021 is to reach 
a level of excellence in our service for cancer treatment by that 
year.     
 
We are committed to continue investing in the fight against cancer.  
We shall therefore invest in more modern and more effective 
medicines.  We shall also add new medicines against cancer on 
the government formulary list with the ultimate goal being that, 
over a number of years, the whole range of medicines against 
cancer would be free of charge.ii 
136 
 
Government will consult the social partners on the introduction of 
paid special medical leave, in addition to the statutory sick leave, 
to employees diagnosed with cancer who are undergoing 
treatment or some form of cancer therapy. 
 
In line with steps taken by other developed countries, as of 1st 
January 2017 smoking in vehicles in the presence of children will 
be prohibited.  
 
Addolorata Cemetery and Mellieħa Cemetery 
 
Under public private partnership arrangements, works will be 
taken in hand in 2017 on the extension of the Santa Maria 
Addolorata Cemetery and of the Sultana tal-Vittorji Cemetry in 
Mellieħa. 
 
Sport 
 
Mr Speaker, a nation that practises – rather than merely loves – 
sport, is a healthier nation.  For this reason in 2017 we shall 
undertake a number of initiatives aimed at bringing sport closer to 
the people.  
 
Building of more swimming pools 
 
Works are due to start early in 2017 on the construction of an 
indoor pool in the Cottonera Sports Complex whilst a decision 
regarding the building of other similar facilities will be taken after 
137 
 
the completion of the study on another swimming pool in 
Marsascala. 
 
In order to upgrade the National Swimming Pool at tal-Qroqq, in 
2017 the pool deck will be replaced while the spectator stands will 
undergo maintenance.  
 
Other facilities 
 
Extensive works will be carried out at the Marsa Sports Ground for 
the modernisation of existing facilities and for the use of these 
facilities for different sport disciplines. 
 
It is also planned to extend facilities at Maria Assunta School in 
Ħamrun to cater for other disciplines including snooker, handball, 
table tennis, table football, basketball, darts and a jogging track. 
 
Works will start in 2017 on a new sports complex in Santa Venera.  
It is also planned to modernize the Ta' Qali Sports Pavilion used 
by the Malta Basketball Association.  We shall also work on the 
implementation of a new shooting range following a public call. 
 
Conference facilities will be added to the Cottonera Sports 
Complex whilst in Marsascala, in addition to the swimming pool 
that I have already mentioned, we shall also build a new diving 
centre and a football pitch. 
 
138 
 
In 2017 we shall conclude the proposal for the project at the Marsa 
horse racing track which, in collaboration with private interests, 
would bring the track up to international standards.  
 
Following a call for expressions of interest to study the possibility 
of a motor racing track, which generated much interest, in 2017 we 
shall take a decision about the next step in this project.  
 
Culture 
 
We firmly believe that art and culture are essential to the process 
of national development; and in 2017 we shall continue to attach 
to this sector the importance that it deserves by means of the 
following measures.  
 
National Fund for Excellence 
 
We plan to set up a National Fund for Excellence to be 
administered by the Malta Arts Council through which grants will 
be given to artists and professionals in the fields of culture and 
creativity.iii 
 
139 
 
Project for local theatres 
 
We shall endeavour to develop more than fifty local theatres 
around Malta and Gozo to enable them to be used for rehearsals 
and artistic productions. In this way private owners of these 
theatres will be able to plan any necessary structural renovations 
on their own and utilise their artistic potential.  In this connection 
the aim is to set up an investment scheme so that these spaces, 
some of which are of historical importance, could be developed 
into spaces for artistic activity. 
 
Valletta 2018 
 
Thanks to Valletta 2018 we shall be leaving for posterity a living 
legacy that will encourage generations of artists to develop their 
talents.    It is my pleasure to announce that substantial progress 
has been made in the preparation of a cultural programme through 
fruitful collaboration between Government and private interests. 
 
After many long years of neglect in our capital city, we shall go 
ahead with ongoing initiatives to embellish its cultural attractions in 
connection with Valletta 2018 and the regeneration of Valletta. 
 
These include the New Arts Museum (MUŻA) at the Auberge 
d'Italie, the Valletta Design Cluster at the Old Abattoir, the 
regeneration of Strait Street, the Old Market, the rehabilitation of 
the Jesuits’ Church, the New Museum of Contemporary Art, the 
140 
 
façade of the Manoel Theatre and the restoration of the facades of 
Palazzo Ferreria and Palazzo Castellania. 
 
In addition to these works, we are planning other projects that are 
associated with the regeneration of the lower end of Valletta.  A 
call for expressions of interest will be issued in 2017 for the private 
sector to submit proposals for the regeneration of the Fish Market 
and the building adjacent to Barriera Wharf, the Evans Building as 
well as the Examinations Centre near Fort St Elmo.iv 
 
Preservation of the historical heritage 
 
Following the demerger of MEPA into two separate authorities, the 
role and functions of the Superintendence for Cultural Heritage to 
safeguard the country's historical heritage have gained in 
importance.  For this purpose, in 2017 we shall allocate additional 
resources to the Superintendence to enable it to improve its 
operations.  
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
i  Since the opening of paediatric emergency facilities at Mater Dei Hospital, 
twelve thousand children were treated during the first eight months of this year. 
 
ii  The possible introduction of a facility for clinical testing in Malta for new 
cancer drugs is under consideration. 
141 
 
                                                                                                                                              
iii  This initiative is intended to enable artists and professionals to follow training 
programmes for their continued professional development, including training 
programmes in cultural leadership. 
 
In order to further develop the creative talents of our youths,  we shall be 
launching programmes for young artists.  Through these programmes, run by 
the Malta Arts Council, young artists will be able to develop creative projects 
and follow apprenticeship and mentoring courses so that in this way we would 
be assisting them to take up careers in the cultural and creative industries. 
 
iv  The intention in this regard is to change the current use of these buildings 
and give the private sector the opportunity to invest in these projects with the 
aim of generating more activity in the capital city. 
142 
 
FURTHER BUILDING AN INCLUSIVE SOCIETY 
 
Mr Speaker, I would like to conclude this Budget Speech in the 
same way that I started it, by making sure that the wealth that we 
create will reach everyone. In addition to the package of measures 
for financial assistance, the Government is implementing others 
initiatives by means of the provision of services, centres, 
programmes and other projects that will bring about an 
improvement in the quality of life of our families.  
 
I shall start by mentioning the assistance that we will extend in the 
field of social housing.  
 
Housing Estates 
 
New lifts and embellishment works in Government residential 
estates 
 
Towards the last quarter of 2017 the Housing Authority, with the 
assistance of European funds, will embark on an important project 
spread over six years to install lifts and carry out embellishment 
works in government housing estates.  The embellishment and 
maintenance of common parts and the installation of lifts will be 
carried out in 211 buildings which house around 4,400 persons, 
including 1,200 elderly persons and 200 persons with disabilities.  
Apart from the buildings themselves, the embellishment works will 
also include surrounding areas where residents will have access 
to a better and more attractive neighbourhood.i  
143 
 
A €50 million social housing project 
 
In 2017 works will start on the construction of the first units in a 
massive €50 million project that I announced in my last Budget 
speech and which over a period of three years will result in a 
considerable number of new units for social accommodation.ii 
 
A personal assistant to persons with disabilities 
 
We are giving consideration to the launching of a scheme that is 
intended to provide a personal assistant to persons with 
disabilities according to their needs. The scheme, based on that 
adopted by the Independent Living Institute in Sweden, will be 
open to persons of any age, with the cost of service provision 
being shared between Government and those who make use of it.  
The annual expenditure is estimated to reach just over €1 million. 
 
Continuation of the Soċjetà Ġusta (Just Society) project 
 
We shall continue to promote the Soċjetà Ġusta project with the 
aim of establishing ten small homes in the community for persons 
with disabilities. These homes will give peace of mind to parents of 
persons with disabilities who worry about their children's future 
once they themselves pass away.  So far we have established 
three such homes (in Siġġiewi; Victoria, Gozo; and Żurrieq) and 
next year we plan to complete several other homes.  
 
 
144 
 
Assisting the Elderly 
Respite Service 
 
We shall introduce a respite service for carers who are informally 
but directly involved in the care of elderly persons in their own 
home.  Through this service, every six weeks these carers will be 
given support in the form of a week's rest, up to a maximum of 
three rest periods per year. In this way we will ensure that these 
carers will have appropriate social support and will not suffer from 
social exclusion.  
 
Meals on Wheels 
 
The tender for Meals on Wheels has been awarded and the 
waiting list is expected to be eliminated up by the end of the year.  
This development will come about thanks to an increase in the 
budget allocation for this purpose with the aim of further bolstering 
community services.  Government has also taken steps to 
upgrade the quality of the meals provided and to reduce risks in 
connection with their distribution.  
 
Project at the Rużar Briffa building  
 
With regard to care of the elderly, we shall concentrate works on 
the extension and upgrading of the Rużar Briffa building in St 
Vincent de Paule.  The aim is to ensure that both inmates as well 
as staff will be able to live and work in an improved environment.  
145 
 
By means of this project the number of wards will go up to six, 
creating more space for new admissions to this centre.   
 
Extension and modernisation of the Mtarfa Day Care Centre 
 
The Mtarfa Day Care Centre will be extended and modernised so 
as to offer increased facilities and improved accommodation for 
persons who make use of it during the week.iii 
 
In this field we shall work not only on the refurbishing and 
embellishment of the ten existing day care centres for persons 
with disabilities, but also on the opening of another similar facility 
in the centre of Malta to make this service accessible to more 
persons who are in need of it.  
 
Further work on the REACH Project 
 
In the meantime work has continued on the REACH project 
announced last year that will be established in Naxxar.iv This is a 
project that incorporates various services that are suitable for 
everyone, including persons with disabilities.  This project is meant 
to continue to address the waiting list for the Sapport Agency, with 
professional services and a modern infrastructure designed 
according to the Universal Design concept.  
 
 
146 
 
Social welfare 
 
The Foundation for Social Welfare Services feels that supervised 
access to children by parents who do not reside with them, or by 
other members of the family, is of the utmost importance.  These 
visits offer an opportunity to overcome arising difficulties and to 
improve relations between the parties concerned.   For this 
purpose, the Foundation will enhance the service of supervised 
access by trained professionals and in a suitable location where 
children feel safer and better able to relate with their families in a 
healthy manner.  On the other hand, parents will be better able to 
learn the skills needed to raise their children. 
 
Safe Centre for Young Girls 
 
The Foundation will be setting up a Safe Centre for Young Girls 
which operates on a therapeutic system, with the aim of helping 
young girls with challenging behaviour that may be harmful to 
themselves and to persons around them and may lead them to fall 
foul of the law.  Apart from being kept away from danger, at this 
Centre they would learn the skills that are necessary to live in 
society and fully participate in the community. 
 
 
147 
 
Sedqa pilot project 
 
Sedqa Agency, within the Foundation, will be rolling out a pilot 
project focused on couples, with minor children, who are going 
through the process of separation with the aim of better 
addressing their problems and needs in the light of the Positive 
Parenting Policy published by the Ministry for the Family and 
Social Solidarity.  This programme, which is being undertaken in 
collaboration with the Ministry of Justice, Culture and Local 
Government, will address the needs of Maltese society in order to 
eliminate poverty and social exclusion as far as possible, 
particularly among children of couples in the process of personal 
separation. 
 
Social fund for students in difficulty 
 
We shall set up a fund to improve the quality of life of students 
experiencing difficulties, not only to assist them in material living 
but also in the fields of culture and sport. The Ministry for 
Education and Labour and the Ministry for the Family and Social 
Solidarity are meant to collaborate with college principals and 
heads of schools to administer this fund in the best interests of 
students.  
 
In its first year, we shall allocate the sum of €1 million for this fund. 
 
 
 
148 
 
The President's Foundation for the Wellbeing of Society 
 
Finally I would like to point out that with the co-operation of the 
President's Foundation for the Wellbeing of Society we shall also 
be in a position to help in reducing problems associated with 
particular aspects of social exclusion, such as the problem that 
arises when children, for one reason or another, leave school 
early. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
i  The total cost of the project is estimated at over €23 million, 80% of which will 
be secured from the European Regional Development Fund. (ERDF) 
 
ii  In addition, an application was submitted for European funds to carry out 
upgrading and embellishment works in all the housing estates in the country 
over a span of five years.  The proposed project includes the installation of 
hundreds of lifts in blocks with persons with mobility problems, an upgrade of 
common parts in apartment blocks as well as extensive landscaping work in the 
surrounding areas.  
 
iii  The project is expected to be completed over a period of three years and will 
cost around €9 million.  The first two phases are due to be finished by the end 
of 2017. 
 
iv  All the preparatory work has been completed and an application for European 
Funds has been submitted. 
149 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Mr Speaker, the budget I have just announced is based on 
responsible and prudent forecasts.  Like the three preceding 
budgets we have built our proposals on realistic grounds.  All our 
fiscal targets are reachable with the weight of public debt expected 
to fall below 60 per cent. 
 
We budgeted not only for 2017 but also for the years that follow. 
 
Gone are the days when the attractive sections of the budget 
remain merely on paper because they would be based on 
forecasts that would be totally off the mark. 
 
I am pleased to say that under this government, this never 
happened nor will it ever happen. 
 
This is the reason behind the Maltese Government's success in 
earning the trust of families, businesses and international financial 
and political institutions. 
 
The 'A-' rating of our country awarded by Standard and Poor's 
reflected an upgrade for our country and not a downgrade.  That is 
the difference. 
 
 
 
150 
 
At the same time, we rebuilt the country's economic sinews.  We 
gave a new lease of life to thousands of unemployed young 
people and to thousands of persons who were dependent on 
social benefits, thousands of women who wanted, but were 
unable, to join the workforce, thousands of low income pensioners 
- many thousands who were left to fall by the wayside by our 
predecessors.  
 
Mr Speaker, in this speech I have clearly shown that, despite all 
these successes, the best is yet to come.  With a strong economy, 
our country can decide its own future. 
 
By means of this budget we are making sure that prosperity will 
reach everyone. 
 
Thank you.
