Mr Speaker, 
We have achieved our objectives. We are placing our country’s finances 
on solid ground. Our economy has resumed a healthy rhythm. We are 
creating thousands of new jobs. We have sustained major developments 
in education, health, and in the social sphere.
All this has been achieved by the Maltese and Gozitan population 
through our determined work over the past years.
This evening, on behalf of my Government, I would like to convey a 
message of gratitude, determination and clear direction.
The Budget I am presenting this evening in front of this House of 
Representatives has a single and unequivocal aim: securing our future 
and that of our children.
Mr Speaker, 
Over the past weeks we have made a genuine effort to listen to, discuss 
and scrutinize everyone’s wishes, ideas and aspirations.
We have now prepared this Budget. Our aim is, while building on 
previous budgets, to continue using our best endeavours to achieve the 
ambitious goals we have set for our country. We want to: 
�
invest as much as possible in education for our children and for 
each and every one of us, as well as in research and innovation 
�
achieve a quality leap in health services through the opening of 
Mater Dei Hospital 
�
improve our environment in its entirety 
�
continue strengthening our country’s finances and economy 
�
adjust our taxes and introduce other measures to incentivise work, 
while allowing everyone to benefit from what our country has 
managed to achieve  
4
�
prepare our country for adoption of the euro, another important 
step in the economic and social development of our country, and 
�
make best use of EU Funds that we have managed to obtain for 
Malta and Gozo.
Mr Speaker,  
This is a budget made by the people for the people.   
The human being, or rather each and every one of us, is the focal point of 
our work. We favour no particular ideology or class. The human being 
constitutes the alpha and omega of all our efforts in their entirety. The 
economy, trade, education, laws, fiscal measures, technology, the euro, 
the European Union – to mention but a few – are not ends within 
themselves, but merely tools for the service of our people.
The yardstick by which politicians’ achievements are measured is the 
extent to which we use these tools wisely and with commitment in order 
to improve the lives of all Maltese and Gozitan citizens.  
In using these tools, we must acknowledge the fact that although we all 
possess the same dignity, our needs differ. While safeguarding the 
dignity of everyone, we must afford preferential treatment to those who 
are more vulnerable and who therefore require more attention in order to 
live in dignity. Man manifests his worth by showing solidarity towards 
others. Solidarity is not a slogan but a way of life. Without interacting 
with others we impoverish ourselves, and consequently economic and 
social progress must work in a complementary manner.  
Although each and every person has needs which must be seen to without 
undue delay, we cannot allow such short term concerns to detract us from 
long term needs, both for us and our children. In order to secure a healthy 
present we must secure our long-term future, through a Government 
which embraces a serious and credible policy which is not vitiated by the 
common temptation to pander to instant gratification.
In building a society which fully respects man’s dignity and which 
secures our future, a key role must be played by the social partners and 
members of civil society, including the ever-increasing number of 
voluntary 
organisations, 
professional 
bodies, 
and 
unions. 
We 
acknowledge this role, encourage it and expect it. Government, politics, 
5
administrative bureaucracy, and the services we provide cannot work in 
isolation, and can never aspire to give to society what families, 
communities, Local Councils and voluntary initiatives can give. These 
are all important partners in the building and strengthening of Maltese 
society.
In order to give a valuable service conducive towards securing our future, 
we must take into account the wishes, needs and aspirations of all 
Maltese and Gozitan citizens. Finally however Government is also 
responsible, after listening, consulting, and discussing, to give a clear 
direction.
This Budget gives the clear direction necessary for the attainment of the 
aforementioned 
goals, 
with 
the 
participation 
of 
all 
parties.

Budget preparation
Mr Speaker,  
The preparation of this budget was based on a process of consultation 
and dialogue. Since January, we set in motion consultation meetings 
aimed towards optimising use of EU funds to the tune of 805 million 
euro. Towards the beginning of August, we published the Pre-Budget 
Document. For the second year running, Government has pre-announced 
its thoughts about the budget. We entered into discussions with 
employers associations and unions. We sent the main points to all 
households. We received feedback and proposals from thousands of 
persons. We also held specific meetings in order to continue listening to 
ideas and discussing. 
I am pleased to confirm that many ideas and proposals emerged from this 
process. These were very helpful for us to understand better the 
aspirations of our people. We reflected deeply on the feedback received, 
contemplated possible courses of action, an analysed the impact thereof. 
We have now arrived at what I am about to present this evening.
We wish to be in a position where we can accede to everyone’s wishes. 
Nonetheless, we feel that it would be grossly irresponsible should we in 
any way whatsoever jeopardise our country’s financial consolidation, that 
is, jeopardise what the Maltese population has managed to achieve with 
much toil and effort. This is therefore a cautious budget which does not 
attempt to go beyond our present means.

Challenges we have Faced
Mr Speaker 
Last year we had promised that we wanted to build on our strengths, the 
strengths of all Maltese and Gozitans. We committed our best common 
efforts to secure our future. We had to face challenges and difficulties 
which often came from beyond our shores. I am pleased to announce that 
thanks to the ability and efforts of all Maltese and Gozitans, we have set 
the wheel in motion and started to reap the fruits. Now it is imperative, 
that step by step, in order not to upset what has been built – we continue 
reaping such benefits for our people. 
This does not mean that we had no major hurdles.  
The steep rise in oil prices has placed great pressure on the prices of 
various products and services that we use. We are aware that the 
surcharge had an impact on our families and industries. The increase in 
oil prices we experienced during 2006 resulted in an increased 
expenditure of approximately Lm48 million when compared to 2005. 
Without such problem, our aim of financial sustainability would have 
been achieved with a much lesser degree of sacrifice. We would have had 
more than half a million Maltese liri extra per week to spend on 
improving the quality of life of our people.  
Another major challenge was that of illegal immigration. Until recently, 
we used to view this as a problem for other countries. This problem has 
now reached our shores. This is a major challenge which we cannot face 
alone. We have succeeded in persuading the European Union to step in 
and help us. Nonetheless, we feel that much more needs to be done. In 
fact, tomorrow morning I will be attending a summit for EU leaders in 
Finland where we shall inter alia discuss the issue of illegal immigration. 
The changes in tourism trends were also a substantial challenge. When 
towards the beginning of this year it had seemed that we were not going 
to achieve the targets we set ourselves in tourism, we had to find the 
necessary finance in order to incentivise low-cost airlines to operate new 
routes towards our country. This we managed to achieve following 
extensive consultation with all sectors involved. 
8
We also experienced the closure of two factories which complexively led 
to the loss of over one thousand jobs. However, our economy managed to 
create enough new jobs such that unemployment rates today are roughly 
at the same levels as last year. Not only so, but we have also managed to 
achieve the highest rate of persons in gainful employment. Today the 
labour situation is much better than how we found it in 1998, and is 
actually among the best we have had over the past eight years. But this is 
not enough. We believe that as long as there remains at least one person 
genuinely looking for work, the challenge remains open.

Review of the Economic Situation
International Economic Developments 
Mr Speaker, 
I am placing a copy of The Economic Survey on the table of the House. 
Although our country is an island, we are not an isolated country, and 
whatever happens around the world has a bearing on us. For this reason, 
in Table No. 1, which I request the House to take as read, I am presenting 
a brief overview of the international economy. 
Table 1:  International Economy
In the first six months of this year, the world economy grew at a 
somewhat fast rate. Although it seems that this growth rate slowed 
down slightly in the second half of the year, the world economy is 
expected to register a growth rate of 5.5% throughout this year. On 
a European level, Euro zone economies and, especially the major 
economies, continued to recover throughout this year following a 
somewhat poor start earlier on. Consequently, the latest indications 
show that the Euro zone economy is expected to grow by 2.5 per 
cent.
The recovery of the world economy and especially those of Malta’s 
trading partners helped and is expected to continue helping the 
Maltese economy. 
Projections for the coming year indicate that world economy 
performance is expected to be somewhat slower than that registered 
this year. These projections also apply to most advanced economies 
with which Malta has close trading relations.
During this year the world economy continued operating in the 
shadow of risks arising from financial imbalances on a global scale 
and new uncertainties concerning the performance of the US 
economy, as well as continuous uncertainties caused by geo-
10
political instability, terrorist threats and diseases. Moreover, the 
world economy this year continued to be greatly impacted by the 
ever-increasing prices of oil and various other essential products 
and raw materials. These developments led to higher rates of 
inflation in many countries, including ours.
The Globalisation Challenge  
The process of globalisation is creating major challenges for everyone, 
including our country. However, we feel that globalisation should be 
viewed as an opportunity. Our country has been operating in an open 
economic environment for years. Over the past years, we have used our 
intellect and skills to great effect and we can be proud of our 
achievements. We must now continue building on our strengths, while 
restructuring our economy towards high value-added sectors. 
This point is illustrated in further detail in Table No. 2, which I request 
the house to take as read. 
Table 2: The Globalisation Challenge
The world economy is continuing to change at a fast pace. 
Competition in world markets has increased greatly. Jobs are 
nowadays created and lost much faster than ever before. These 
same can be said about ideas and movement of capital. At the same 
time, enterprises and industries are being created which require 
highly-skilled workers. Creation of wealth nowadays depends to a 
far greater degree on creativity and innovation. Consequently, in 
order for our economy to be competitive it is imperative that we 
become more innovative, attain higher skills and be more 
enterprising.
All developed countries are undergoing substantial changes in their 
economic structures. We are no exception in this regard. While 
some of our sectors have slowed down or have been wiped out, 
other sectors have been created and have flourished. It is important 
that we understand well the realities surrounding us in order to 
bolster and sustain what can truly work in our context, while taking 
11
on board the continuous challenges which the dynamic world 
economy is presenting us with.  
We must continue restructuring in order to face up to forces exerted 
by world markets, improve investment, and consequently continue 
improving the economic growth rate in our country. It is for this 
reason that we are emphasising on training, innovation, investment 
and enterprise, because we are aware that in today’s global context, 
success is achieved by those who have the courage required to 
create the necessary environment and invest in such fields.
Government’s Economic Policy 
Macro-economic stability is necessary for sustainable economic growth 
and job creation. All in all, a stable economic environment minimizes 
business risks while encouraging investment. For this reason, 
Government will continue using its best endeavours for our country to 
achieve a low and stable level of inflation, and a fiscal policy which 
assures that public finances continue to be placed on ever more solid 
ground. This should be conducive towards using our fiscal policy, when 
necessary and possible, to influence the economic sphere in our country 
and to aid and sustain our monetary policy.  
We are strictly adhering to the rules contained in the Stability and 
Growth Pact as we believe that this is what our country requires and 
deserves.
Price fluctuations and stability are being closely monitored in order to 
protect low-earners as well as our country’s competitiveness. At the same 
time we are insisting that wage increases correspond to increases in 
productivity in our economy.   
In the sphere of public finances, great efforts have been and are being 
made in order to ensure their sustainability. While we insist that all that is 
due to Government must be collected, we are using our best endeavours 
to eliminate waste and to curtail public spending. In fact, public 
spending, except for that in sectors such as health, pensions, social 
services and education, is being either reduced or kept at the same levels 
as those for the present year.   
12
This Government’s consistent, clear and determined policies are leading 
to stability which gives rise to further development. We were and still are 
consistent in our strategy towards our economic and social development 
and Malta’s role within the European Union. We are now working 
towards the next logical step for our country within the European Union: 
introduction of the euro from the 1st of January 2008. We believe that this 
step is another important signal in the economic management of our 
country. It is a step which should increase stability because it reduces 
risks, and opens new horizons and opportunities for those who want to 
work in our country. 
Towards a More Productive Country 
Government will continue working towards the continuous improvement 
of productivity in our country. We must use our limited resources wisely 
and effectively for the well being of our people.
Our strategy is based on two pillars. Firstly, the maintenance of a stable 
macro-economic environment, which helps and enables our people and 
enterprises to invest for the future. Secondly, we must implement the 
necessary reforms which help our markets to work more efficiently. 
Consequently we require further investment, education and training, 
more research and innovation, a more enterprising culture, fair and 
transparent competition in our markets and more productivity in the 
public sector.
A Helpful and Productive Public Sector 
The public sector is an essential part of the governmental, economic and 
social infrastructure of our country. We want a dynamic public sector, 
which is in tune with and sensitive to ongoing changes in the country and 
abroad. A public sector which responds to our country’s needs is an 
important platform for the economic and social development we require 
in our country.
The public sector must justify Government’s investment and trust and 
continue becoming more competitive. Government will continue 
insisting upon and demanding more value-for-money and enhanced 
productivity in this sector in order to facilitate the economic and social 
development of our people. We believe that the public sector should be 
13
another engine which helps our country to become more competitive. 
These are the guiding principles on which Government based the 
negotiations leading to the collective agreement which was signed in 
October 2005 for a six-year period. 
Maltese Economic Situation 
In the first six months of this year, the Maltese economy grew by 2.6 per 
cent in real terms, when compared to the equivalent period for the 
previous year. Growth thus doubled when compared to the previous year, 
clearly showing that the Maltese economy has now picked up 
impressively. This positive result was achieved in spite of intense 
competition in international markets, international economic instability 
and oil prices.
Almost all economic sectors registered an improvement when compared 
to the first six months of the previous year. Certain sectors such as 
transport and communications and the financial sector grew at a 
substantial rate. Other sectors grew at a lesser rate, though still 
satisfactory. The value added of the hotel and restaurants sectors 
decreased slightly. 
Over this period, investment in buildings and machinery increased by 7.4 
per cent when compared to the previous year, reaching over Lm210 
million. This is a heavy investment which clearly shows the ever-
increasing confidence in Maltese economic development. 
During the same period, our workers’ income increased by more than Lm 
13 million or 3 per cent and exceeded Lm461 million. Profits registered 
by our businesses increased by almost Lm26 million, reaching almost 
Lm388 million.   
Tourism Sector 
During the first eight months of the year, the number of tourists visiting 
our country decreased by 29,800 to 767,836, while the average amount of 
nights spent by tourists in our country increased to 9.8. The number of 
cruise passengers visiting our country increased by more than 31 per 
cent. Gross profit from tourism maintained the same level as in the 
previous year. In fact, during the first six months of this year, profits 
from tourism were estimated to be in excess of Lm101 million. This 
14
means that, per capita, each tourist spent approximately Lm215, an 
increase of approximately Lm6 when compared to the previous year.  
While we acknowledge the challenges that tourism is facing in our 
country, it would be mistaken to depict the situation worse than it is. We 
believe that this sector is still viable, and while we must continue 
working hard to achieve better results, we are convinced that we have a 
solid basis on which to continue building. We are determined to do 
whatever is necessary in order to overcome the challenges faced by the 
tourism sector and to increase its share in the Maltese economy. We have 
already done a lot in this regard. We invested heavily to improve our 
tourism product, especially in our historical and cultural heritage and the 
environment. And we shall continue doing so. However, in order to 
achieve the desired results, it is necessary that we all join forces and give 
our contribution. The success of our tourism product depends on each 
and every one of us.
Manufacturing Sector 
Following the upheavals we experienced last year in the manufacturing 
sector, this sector which is so important for our country started 
recovering and growing again. Sales by large enterprises increased by 
more than 8 per cent to almost Lm495 million in the first six months of 
this year, when compared to the same period of last year. Investment in 
this sector increased by almost 30 per cent to more than Lm31 million. 
This is a positive sign which shows confidence in this sector’s viability. 
All in all, the average income of workers employed in the manufacturing 
sector increased by more than Lm7 per week, to almost Lm125 per week.  
Mr Speaker, 
Restructuring efforts which have been carried out and others which are 
still underway in this productive sector are yielding the desired results.
Existing factories are continuing to invest and have stepped up their 
production. New sectors, such as the pharmaceutical sector, continue to 
grow. These are now registering sales of approximately Lm30 million 
yearly and employ around 800 people. 
The dynamic process currently being undergone by the manufacturing 
sector must be supported in every way. Governent believes that in our 
country there is a niche for a manufacturing sector oriented towards the 
15
production of high added-value products, which will allow our country to 
compete successfully in international markets. As promised in the Pre-
Budget Document, today Government is publishing an industrial policy 
document which renews and fine-tunes its strategy for this sector.  
Foreign Trade 
In the first eight months of this year, importation in our country increased 
by more than Lm129 million to almost Lm965 million. During the same 
period, exportation increased by more than Lm65 million and now 
exceeds Lm593 million. Foreign trade imbalance increased by more than 
Lm64 million due to greater importation of industrial supplies and 
objects of a capital nature. Eventually, many of these will be re-exported, 
meaning more economic growth. This increase is also caused by the 
increase in oil expenditure at higher prices. 
Foreign Investment 
In the first six months of this year, foreign investment in our country 
amounted to Lm312 million, that is Lm212 million more than last year 
and actually Lm127 million more than the whole of last year!
These figures speak for themselves: our policies are delivering. Ours is a 
credible country embracing serious policies. We are succeeding in 
attracting the foreign investment necessary in order to continue creating 
jobs and wealth in our country.
Inflation
As we projected last year, inflation this year was pushed up due to the 
steep rise in oil prices. These increases were reflected in the retail price 
index and hence in the inflation registered for this year. Consequently, in 
September, inflation reached the rate of 3.42 per cent.   
It now seems that oil prices have started to stabilize slightly. We hope 
that what we experienced over the past few weeks is a sign of times to 
come. While it is projected that the rate of inflation will start falling 
towards the end of this year, Government will be using its best 
endeavours to ensure that prices in our markets remain just and 
transparent. In this connection, it is worth mentioning the agreement 
which Government reached with importers of medicines and which has 
already led to lower prices for a number of medicines in our country. 
16
This agreement also includes an agreement in principle concerning 
transparency in prices of medicines. I hope that over the coming weeks 
this mechanism becomes operative.   
Creation of Jobs 
As I mentioned earlier on in this Budget speech, our final aim is not only 
solid public finances and a healthy economy, but a good quality of life 
for our people and a secure future. Work is the key. Work provides a 
living and dignity to our workers and families.   
Creation of work is our absolute priority.
In June we attained a record of 146,498 persons in gainful employment, 
of which 139,437 work full time. This occurred at the same time when 
employment in the public sector was reduced. Table No. 3 explains the 
situation in the labour market.

In June, the number of persons registering for work in the first part of the 
register amounted to 6,601. The unemployment rate stood at 4.5 per cent. 
Although this success in job creation speaks for itself, I believe that one 
person unemployed is one too many. Therefore, under my stewardship 
this Government will leave no stone unturned in this endeavour.  
In this connection, I must emphasise the substantial investment 
Government has made in the education sector in order to help each and 
every person acquire the necessary skill set required for work and in 
order to remain relevant for the labour market. We want our education 
and training systems to remain continually updated in order that our 
workers will be able to respond to changes and demands in the labour 
market and improve productivity in the country. It is in this way that in 
today’s world we can secure the future of our workers and their families.

2006 Overview  
Mr Speaker, 
An overview of the present year would not be complete without giving 
account of a number of success stories. 
Financial Position 
We had announced last year that it was the aim of this Government to 
reduce the deficit to between 3% and 2.8% of GDP, as compared to a 
corresponding figure of 3.9% for the previous year. 
I am pleased to report to the House, that this goal has been achieved and 
it is expected that this year the deficit will be Lm57 million from Lm75 
million last year. This means a decrease of Lm18 million on the previous 
year. Furthermore, it is worth stressing that when the deficit is computed 
in accordance with EU regulations, this year’s deficit will work out at 
2.6%, that is, Lm55 million. 
Tables 4 and 5, which by leave of the House is to be taken as read, show 
the Financial Position for 2006. The detailed Income and Expenditure 
Statements are appended towards the end of this speech.

Table 5: Government’s Financial Position
Government revenue increased by Lm69 million to reach Lm965 million.  
The increase in tax revenues reflects the positive trends in the economic 
performance of the country in its areas of economic activity. It is worth 
noting that in the last budget, that of 2006, Government did not introduce 
new forms of taxation nor did it increase existing tax rates. 
Income tax revenues increased by Lm28m. The major part of this 
increase is attributable to increased activity in most economic sectors, 
including employment income. This is also reflected in the significant 
increase in social security contributions of Lm14 million. This has 
happened due to the increase in the number of gainfully employed people 
this year, as well as the increase in Malta’s average employment income 
which is recorded at 5 percent with respect to the previous year. VAT 
revenues increased by around Lm6 million with respect to the previous 
year. The actual revenue appears to be slightly less than the estimates. 
This is due to larger refunds made to large private sector construction 
projects that were expected to account for income this year but in fact 
will do this next year. Government has also registered a further Lm7 
million increase in revenue from other sources, mainly due to the Italian 
and EU Protocol funding. 
Government recurrent expenditure increased by Lm33 million when 
compared to the previous year. The main increase is in social service 
pensions, which is around Lm12 million more than the previous year.  
Government also increased its contribution to the Social Security 
Contributory Fund by Lm5 million as a result of increased employment 
income. There was also a Lm2 million expenditure increase in the elderly 
sector. An additional Lm3 million were also transferred to Enemalta 
Corporation to reduce the impact of the international fuel price increases. 
There is also an increase in public sector wages of around Lm 4 million 
as estimated as well as an increase in tax refunds paid of Lm5 million. 
There was also an expenditure increase of Lm3 million in interest 
payments on loans since the expected privatisation programme was not 
fully completed. 
Capital expenditure was also increased by Lm20 million, compared to the 
previous year. Increases of Lm2 million was spent on the education 
sector, Lm2 million on the tourism sector, Lm4 million on Gozo, and 
21
Lm2 million on the health sector, apart from the Mater Dei Hospital 
project. The agriculture and environment sectors benefited from an 
additional Lm7 million allocation during this year, a reflection of 
Government’s commitment towards this sector. There was also a further 
investment of Lm4 million in sewage treatment resources. 
At all levels of education, we are carrying out the biggest investment 
ever. Today, from every Lm100 we produce, we spend Lm6 on 
education. And this is already yielding results. I will illustrate briefly: in 
the last five years, the number of early school leavers decreased by 10 
percent, youths in post-secondary or vocational courses increased by 26 
percent, while 20,000 youths participate in various fields and levels of 
advanced and higher education. Our country can indeed be proud of the 
fact that even during times when we are trying to curtail public spending, 
it still continued investing fully on education.
The same can be said for the environment sector in our country, ranging 
from waste management, to renewable sources of energy, afforestation, 
agriculture and fisheries, and monitoring of air quality. Today our 
country is addressing these issues seriously and with the required heavy 
investment. 
Although we managed to achieve the strict financial objectives which we 
set ourselves during this year, our country still continued sustaining its 
social fabric and the related expenditure. This year alone, increase in 
pensions amounted to Lm10.8 million more than in the previous year. To 
these, one may add the vast array of other social benefits as well as the 
net of personalised social services in the fields of housing, children, 
families, disabled persons, drugs, alcohol, mental health, and many 
others. In these sectors, Government also continued sustaining an 
extensive solidarity programme. Besides, we set in motion the pensions 
reform, an important reform which while not affecting present-day 
pensioners or those who are close to being of pensionable age, secures 
the future of our youth. 
In Gozo we achieved substantial progress in developing the physical and 
tourism infrastructure. The main challenge for Gozo remains 
employment, where the progress seen in Malta has not been mirrored in 
Gozo. Government is doing its part in this regard by transferring back-
office work to Gozo.
22
Throughout this year, we left no stone unturned in order to continue 
making a success out of Malta’s EU Membership. Malta was one of the 
first new Member States to commit all its Structural Funds for the 2004-
2006 period towards projects, and is the only country to have committed 
all funds derived from the Cohesion Funds. Not only so, but our country 
is one of the few new Member States to have used all funds for 2006, six 
months in advance of the stipulated date, that is December 2006. Not 
only has our country managed to use all pre-accession funds at its 
disposal, but it has also benefited from many other funds which other 
countries did not manage to tap into on time. Today I can confirm that 
seventy-eight projects with a combined value of approximately Lm50 
million are being executed in order to improve the standard of living of 
the Maltese and Gozitan population.
A more detailed analysis of these success stories is found in tables No. 6 
to 10 hereunder which I request the House to take as read.
There can be no doubt that we have built on our strengths. This is what 
we promised and it is what we have delivered.  
23
Table 6: Education 
Work is essential as it provides us with our daily living. Education is of 
paramount importance because it gives us the possibility of a better life 
tomorrow. And because we wish our children to enjoy a better living than 
us, we have not been stingy when it comes to expenditure on their 
education. Out of every one hundred liri that the country produces, we 
spend Lm6 on education.  In total we spent Lm109 million on education.  
Moreover, the Foundation for Tomorrow’s Schools spent 16.7 million 
lira for our children to have more attractive and better equipped schools.
Our efforts have helped our children receive a better education, thus 
enabling them to face better tomorrow’s challenges. Today, we have a 
success rate of 6 out of every 10 children who sit for the Junior Lyceum 
examination. In 1985, only 3 out of 10 used to pass this same exam. The 
improved level of education our children receive is encouraging them to 
continue their studies. Today there are 20,000 students attending post-
secondary or tertiary education. Ten years ago there were only 11,000.
We have overhauled the system from the ground up. The college system 
we introduced should revolutionise education. Our children now have a 
choice. If they prefer not to or cannot enrol at University, they may 
choose to study at MCAST. Almost 6,000 have taken up this latter 
choice, while approximately 10,000 are enrolled at University. 
Last July, after a long consultation process on the proposals announced in 
the document For All Children to Succeed, Parliament approved 
Government’s proposals to amend the Education Act. The Minister for 
Education and the Education Division held detailed discussions and 
negotiations with the Malta Union of Teachers, concerning reforms in the 
field of mandatory education. 
While the main fields and levels of education have all been examined 
now as a solid basis for the reforms being implemented by Government, 
and recommendations have been made for their improvement, steps have 
already been taken to implement many of these recommendations. This 
work is set to continue during the course of next year. 
Following the Spiteri Report, various measures were taken with the aim 
of setting in motion the process for the implementation of 
24
recommendations put forward by the Inclusive and Special Education 
Group, which are being administered by the Network Coordinator. 
Special schools are being transformed into resource centres and will be 
reorganized to provide a service to children and youths with special 
needs, according to age. Next year, this should lead to the setting up of a 
post-secondary and vocational facility for youths with special needs who 
may not be able to continue their development at MCAST or University. 
A lot of work has already been carried out with the aim of providing 
more professional training for those who work in this sector, both in 
regular and special schools. Measures are also being adopted to increase 
the number of facilitators specialised in autism, hearing impairments, 
vision impairments, multiple and severe learning difficulties, including 
those connected with difficult emotional behaviour. 
Following the Chalmers report and the report of the Commission for 
Higher Education, further steps have been taken and investment is being 
made to strengthen University and MCAST. We have set up the National 
Commission for Higher Education which operates from the University 
Building in Valletta. While we supported for another year the Youth 
Studies Specialisation Scheme, in collaboration with APS Bank, it was of 
great satisfaction to me to hand out certificates to the first group of 35 
students who were chosen to pursue their studies abroad at Masters or 
PhD level under the Malta Government Scholarship Scheme set up for 
this purpose last year. One must also add the 20 members of University 
academic staff who, through scholarships awarded by the same 
University attained PhD’s in various areas of specialisation. 
The building and modernization of schools, courtesy of the Foundation 
for Tomorrow’s Schools (FTS), has continued at a steady pace. During 
this year, the FTS issued calls for tenders via the Department of 
Contracts or departmental channels to the tune of more than 5 million 
Maltese liri for the construction of new schools and the modernisation of 
38 schools, including the construction of a new school in Qormi, another 
school in Cospicua and the extension of the higher secondary school 
Giovanni Curmi, according to quality standards established at 
St.Benedict College. In part of this work FTS was supported by the 
Technical Services Division within the Education Division. 
All this was accomplished through a heavy investment in the education 
of our children and youths, which on the basis of our public expenditure 
and Gross Domestic Product, compares well with the most advanced 
25
European Union member states. Government’s education policy is 
moving in the right direction and is yielding results, although much 
remains to be done for us to achieve our aims of quality education for 
everyone, for all children to succeed. 
26
Table 7: Environment
The environment is one of the main pillars of the policy embraced by my 
Government. Last year this expenditure increased to Lm32 million. 
During the course of the past year we drew up the National Strategy for 
Sustainable Development. This strategy is intended to serve as a guide 
for our work in favour of the environment we live in. The National 
Strategy for Sustainable Development gives direction on the social and 
economic development in our country which is consistent with 
Government’s general direction as is being indicated in this Budget. 
Waste Management 
This expenditure is yielding tangible reports in sectors which up till 
recently were considered to be the biggest malaise of our environment. 
Suffice to mention the impressive progress being registered at the 
Maghtab landfill, which since being closed in April 2004 has undergone 
impressive changes.   
Work is underway on various fronts. Some work is already producing 
visible results while other work is expected to yield results in the coming 
months. In this connection, I can mention preparatory work for the 
setting up of the first centres for bulky waste, known as civic amenity 
sites. The same applies to preparatory work for the addition of bring-in 
sites around Malta and Gozo. Other preparatory work includes the setting 
up of the first landfill for hazardous waste, as part of the new engineered 
landfill in G�allis.
Another unprecedented investment currently underway is major work 
being carried out for our country to have a waste treatment facility in 
Sant’ Antnin employing the most advanced technology.  Our country is 
placed at an advanced stage to start generating energy from waste, and 
we are therefore in a position where even waste can be a resource for this 
country. In this regard, it is this Government’s intention to distribute 
these benefits amongst our people. 
27
Energy Conservation
In the energy conservation sphere, we launched incentive schemes aimed 
towards reducing electrical consumption in households. These schemes 
were successful. While during 2005 the number of applicants for these 
schemes amounted to 364, these rose to 1,012 throughout this year. To 
date, we have granted more than one hundred thousand Maltese liri in 
VAT refunds under these schemes.  
Leading by example 
Government is doing its part even in its own buildings. Following a 
request for proposals, an offer was recommended for Government to start 
installing 
photovoltaic 
panels 
on 
ministries 
and 
Government 
departments. This offer was made as part of the valuable work being 
carried out by Green Leaders within the public sector. By virtue of this 
initiative, Government is presenting itself as a catalyst for change which 
should lead to the generation of clean energy even on a domestic scale. 
Besides, a draft national plan was drawn up for Green Public 
Procurement. The adoption of Green Public Procurement implies that in 
the context of public procurement, Government agencies must take into 
account not only the economic price but also the environmental price. 
Environment friendly procurement also amounts to leading by example 
and influencing the market.  
Earlier this year, a request for proposals was issued for the installation of 
a wind energy system. I am pleased to announce that nine companies 
have expressed interest in this project. Consequently, following due 
evaluation of all offers submitted, we will be able to proceed to take 
those decisions most appropriate for our country.
Afforestation  
The afforestation project launched by Government for 2006, named 34U, 
was a great success. The target of more than 10,000 trees for this year 
was greatly exceeded. Public response to this campaign was highly 
encouraging, with the donation of 16,000 trees from individuals, 
enterprises and associations planted or being planted in the five areas 
designated by Government.  The five areas are: the extension of Kennedy 
28
Grove in Salini, areas in the limits of Torri l-Ahmar in Mellieha, Xrob l-
Ghagin, Delimara and Ta’ Qali. 
Agriculture and fishing 
In the agricultural sector we continued with the restructuring and 
investment necessary in the farming and local produce processing 
sectors, with investments from structural funds under measures 3.1 and 
3.2, in conjunction with local funding aid as negotiated with the 
European Union under the Special Market Policy Programme for Maltese 
Agriculture.  Up to October, aid during this year amounted to more than 
Lm4.2 million. 
Thanks to such restructuring and investment, sectors such as the poultry 
and egg production sectors have been consolidated and are now in a 
better position to face up to foreign competition.  Furthermore, there has 
been a continuous improvement in milk produced by Malta Dairy 
Products, while pork production has retained a steady presence in the 
local market. In this connection, it is also interesting to note that the Pig 
Breeders Cooperative (PBC) has also tapped into a new market for pork 
in Sicily. 
Developments have also been registered thanks to the work of producers’ 
unions, in particular Gomriza (Malta) and Gozitano (Gozo).  Government 
is also extending its help to enable producers’ unions to sell quality 
products directly to Maltese and Gozitan consumers, and is in the final 
stages to provide aid to another organisation in accordance with EU 
rules.
In the context of the Pitkalija Vegetable Market, work has continued for 
products to be sold on the basis of quality and the informal classification 
of products. Work has also continued with regard to EurepGAP 
certification for potato exportation, an important sector in local farming. 
We have also seen an improvement in tomato production for processing, 
where following difficulties encountered due to fierce competition, we 
have managed to increase production to approximately 10,500 tonnes.
Farmers and villagers have also benefited  from funds under the Rural
Development Plan, Ad Hoc, Meeting Standards and Agri-Environment,
with aid amounting to Lm4 million. Work conducive to the conclusion of 
29
the Rural Development Plan (EAFRD) and the Strategic Plan for EU 
funds for the period 2007-2013 has also been completed.
In the fishing sector, work has also been done which is bearing fruit. 
Fishermen are expected to start reaping the benefits from the 
hardstanding facilities project, which will take place with an investment 
of €2 million, 75% of which is being financed by the European Union. 
Financial aids for fishermen to the tune of Lm123,000 are being 
processed, while aids amounting to Lm54,000 are expected to be 
approved during the course of this year. We are also examining ways 
how we can revise duty-free fuel agreements with fishermen, and this 
revised agreement will be announced once this exercise has been 
finalised.
Roads
During the past year, we continued working on the massive road 
upgrading project. Around 20 kilometres of arterial roads have been 
constructed between �al Far and Im�arr in Malta. Currently, more work 
is being done on arterial roads including those in Luqa, St.Paul’s bay and 
in Gozo. Improved accessibility to Ricasoli is also being seen to, this 
being the site where the SmarCity@Malta project will be implemented. 
Four hundred local roads have also being laid, while the necessary plans 
have been drafted for a further 450 residential streets.
Over the past three years, road works investment in Malta has reached 
the highest level ever. From 2004 until today, Lm19 million from the 
Italian Protocol and Lm10.5 million from European Union funds have 
been spent on this sector. Additionally, one should also mention road 
expenditure in Gozo which is covered by the Budget of the Ministry of 
Gozo.
A steady rhythm has also been maintained in connection with 5 other 
projects co-financed by the European Union under the financial period 
which expired this year. These are the St.Paul’s Bay bypass, �al Far 
road, Manwel Dimech bridge, and in Gozo, the road leading from Rabat 
to San Lawrenz road, as well as the street between Im�arr and 
G�ajnsielem. 
30
Urban Embellishment 
Embellishment of public gardens and road landscaping has continued. 
The embellishment of Hastings Garden and Howard Gardens has been 
completed. Our country’s roundabouts have also been further 
embellished. There have been more than 100 restoration projects, 
including the aquaducts and Upper Barakka. At the same time, an 
extensive valley clean-up project and necessary flood prevention works 
have been accomplished in Qormi and Salina.  
Table 8: The Social Sector 
Government considers the social sector an integral part of the country’s 
economic development. This is not an expense but an investment. This is 
why we have developed a social development policy that addresses 
everybody’s needs but is able to focus attention on the most vulnerable 
requiring support. We are delivering this through programmes with a 
wide beneficiary base as well as assistance programmes targeting special 
needs even when the beneficiaries are expected to be few. 
2006 will be a defining year in terms of the important social 
developments we are managing. We have 
�
published and started a Parliamentary debate on the pensions reform, 
a critical reform for future generations. 
�
the Law on Domestic Violence entered into force, whilst discussions 
are  under way to introduce amendments to the code of police laws to 
safeguard children against the dangers of alcohol.
�
established a directorate to tackle abuse of social benefits, such as in 
unemployment registrations whilst holding employment. This year up 
till the end of August we managed to save the Country more than 
three quarters of a million Maltese liri worth of abuses - an average of 
Lm3,000 daily - which will now be redirected towards those who 
genuinely need them. Therefore, the Lm228 million spent by 
Government on this sector will be addressed to those who deserve 
them. 
31
�
Agenzija Appogg, Agenzija Sedqa and Agenzija Sapport, under the 
Fondazzjoni for Social Welfare Services, delivered a record number 
of services to a record number of people, with the largest budget ever 
made available to them. These services have become an integral part 
of our family support framework. 
�
continued to strengthen the voluntary sector with over Lm1 million in 
direct or contracted aid. We have also concluded the consultation 
process concerning the bill which supports the voluntary sector. 
�
forty-five child care centres benefited from financial and technical aid 
to upgrade the level of services they give according to standards 
published by Government this year. 
�
continued to manage the illegal immigrant issue in our country where 
an increased number of immigrants are being granted refugee status 
and are therefore expected to remain in Malta over a longer period. 
Apart from the financial impact there is the social impact where 
significantly effort is expended to assist these refugees rebuild their 
life locally or abroad, with special care paid to children. 
�
issued 260 dwellings under the shared ownership scheme managed by 
the Housing Authority, through which families with limited means 
may still take up home ownership. 
�
distributed Euro 3 million to NGOs operating in the social sector.  
These funds were made available through the European social funds 
and the Equal programme.  
Our success in the social policy developed and implemented is reflected 
in the several beneficial actions, and their coordination, which are 
resulting in a significant quality leap in people’s lives. For example, 
when the Housing Authority, Agenzija Support and the financial 
assistance given help disabled people to fulfil their aspirations and form 
their own family and become house owners. I am proud to state that the 
work we have undertaken in recent years has brought about a far better 
quality of life to an increasing number of people.  
32
Table 9: Gozo
Gozo has benefited from and contributed towards the whole development 
which took place in this country. However, this Government is aware that 
Gozo has its own particular circumstances and has therefore given it 
special attention, as it has always done.
We have taken care of Gozo’s physical infrastructure, in particular roads. 
Throughout this year Government also continued investing in Gozitan 
workers, since these are the primary resource for the labour sector in 
Gozo. In the education sector, throughout this year we continued the 
modernization programme for primary and secondary schools in Gozo, 
with investment being concentrated on the Rosa Magro primary school in 
Xewkija. In the environment sector, we commenced infrastructural work 
on the construction of a Sewage Treatment Plant. This should allow solid 
and liquid waste generated in Gozo to be treated in a sustainable manner 
which truly respects our country’s natural environment. We have also 
strengthened Gozo Channel, in order for it to be a solid company which 
can also fulfil its duties for the service of Gozitan and Maltese citizens. 
Table 10: European Union  
Three years ago we decided to become EU Members. Two years later we 
can say that Membership has translated into many benefits for our 
people. These benefits did not come about by default. We had to work 
and toil hard to acquire funds for our people, who on a per capita basis,
are benefiting more than other peoples.
The accomplishment of projects thanks to Structural and Cohesion Funds 
is a new experience for us. Last year was particularly hectic in view of 
the fact that many projects were initiated while others were completed. 
This was an important learning curve for us all. At the same time we 
managed to improve the administrative capacity of this country – both in 
the public as well as in the private sector – in order to be able to tap into 
these Funds in a better way. 
33
During the last two years, progress was achieved in various economic 
sectors thanks to these projects financed by Structural and Cohesion 
Funds. These include: 
�
Substantial investment of over Lm7 million in the capabilities of 
Maltese and Gozitan citizens in order to upgrade training and 
education levels of our country’s foremost resource; 
�
Aid schemes for enterprises, farmers and fishermen. More than four 
hundred enterprises are benefiting from these schemes; 
�
Investment in physical infrastructure in the industrial and tourism 
sectors;
�
Capital investment, training as well as information campaigns of 
not less than Lm20 million in favour of the environment, especially 
in the waste management and water management sectors; 
�
Investment in excess of Lm12 million in the transport sector, which 
is already yielding visible results; 
�
Specific projects for Gozo in the fields of transport, tourism, and 
human resources development. 
Contrary to all that was said prior to accession, today I am proud to say 
that Malta was one of the first new Member States to have committed all 
its Structural Funds for the period covering 2004-2006 on projects and is 
the only country to have committed all funds under the Cohesion Fund. 
Not only so, but our country is also one of the few new Member States to 
have used all funds for 2006, six months in advance of the stipulated 
date, that is December 2006. Thanks to the perseverance, ability and 
diligence of all parties concerned, today I can confirm that seventy-eight 
projects to the tune of Lm50 million are being carried out in order to 
improve the standard of living of Maltese and Gozitan citizens. 
Besides these National Programmes, I would also like to mention the fact 
that Malta is also benefiting from a number of other Programmes which 
also fall under the remit of Structural Funds. These are the Programmes 
Equal and Interreg. Equal addresses equality and social inclusion, while 
Interreg consists in regional cooperation programmes between the 
various regions of the European Union having common interests and 
34
challenges. Malta is participating in four Interreg programmes with more 
than fifty approved programmes and others which are expected to be 
approved in the coming days. In this connection I would like to add that 
many Local Councils applied for projects under these Programmes. 
35
Mr Speaker, 
In this regard I reiterate what I had declared on being sworn in as Prime 
Minister. My message to the Maltese people is: do not judge us on our 
words, but judge us on our achievements.
For all these efforts my heartfelt thanks go to my fellow Ministers and 
Members of Parliament. I thank all workers, at every level, within 
Ministries, Government Departments and public corporations. I thank 
workers and managers in the private sector. I thank owners and investors. 
I thank the self-employed. And I also express my heartfelt gratitude to all 
members of the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development.  
I thank you all for efforts throughout this year, which have helped us to 
overcome many obstacles and carry out a lot of work.  
We have achieved a lot together, but much more can be done. And we 
must do more. We must never take our foot off the pedal. We must also 
increase our efficiency and quality in every sector, achieving to the best 
of our abilities as a society, as a nation and with the resources available 
to us. 
I will therefore proceed to present Government’s plan for the 
forthcoming year. This plan embodies a lot of your comments and 
feedback. With your help, we aim to continue securing our future and 
that of our children. 
36
Securing Our Children’s Future 
Mr Speaker, 
I will now announce the work programme my Government is committed 
to achieving next year. 
Financial Position 2007 
Mr Speaker, 
I am presenting a budget that confirms that our country’s finances are 
strong and sustainable. We have reduced the financial deficit to less than 
3 percent of GDP. We are estimating that the deficit in 2007 will be 2.5 
percent of GDP.
I am presenting a more detailed analysis of Government’s revenue and 
expenditure estimates for the coming year in the table hereunder, as well 
as in the financial statements in Tables 11 to 13, which I request the 
House to take as read. Government is projecting a deficit of less than 1 
percent of GDP by 2009.

Table 13:  Government’s estimated revenue and expenditure in 2007
Government is estimating an increase in revenue of Lm27 million over 
2006.
An additional Lm7 million will be received through Income Tax 
revenues, due to the changes in the income tax bands which I will explain 
later on. Social security contributions will also increase by Lm12 million, 
partly due to an additional weekly contribution attributed to 2007 having 
an extra Monday, as well as due to growth in employment and 
employment income resulting from the positive trend being experienced 
in our economy. The increase in excise duty revenues is expected to 
result from the transformation we have made earlier this year in 
Enemalta’s profits on fuels to excise duties. This way we will be able to 
transfer these funds back to the corporation to subsidise electricity 
generation whilst removing cross-subsidisation across Enemalta’s 
divisions and we will be able to continue the fuel liberalisation process 
without a negative impact on electricity bills.  Although there are no 
financial implications, we will continue with the changes we have started 
in 2005 to gradually implement the EU minimum excise duty levels on 
energy products. VAT will contribute an increased revenue of Lm6 
million in line with the growth in economic activity being experienced 
and which we expect to continue in 2007. 
As we have indicated in the Pre-Budget document, Government is in the 
process of better regulating the gaming machines in use in the Gaming 
Sector. We have set out a number of measures that will ensure that these 
machines will be operated within a far better regulatory environment. We 
will introduce a central monitoring system to ensure that children do not 
have access to the gaming machines and to ensure that gaming taxes are 
collected.
Government’s recurrent expenditure is expected to increase by Lm6.6 
million only.   Whilst social service pensions are expected to increase by 
Lm12.1 million, health related expenditure by Lm4 million, and another 
Lm8.3 million transferred to Enemalta, Government will offset these 
increased costs by continuing its expenditure reduction programme 
leading to a reduction in administrative expenditure of around Lm17.8 
million. 
40
Capital investment expenditure will increase by Lm17 million in 2007 
whilst expenditure on the Mater Dei Hospital project will decrease by 
Lm8 million and Italian Protocol funded projects will be concluded by 
the end of this year, we will make an additional Lm10 million investment 
in education, Lm3 million in tourism, Lm2 million in Gozo, Lm4 million 
in health, Lm6 million in the environment and Lm5 million in the roads 
network.
Education and Training 
Mr Speaker, 
My Government, and every Government led by my Party, always 
believed that the key to securing our future lies in education. Investment 
in education is always a guarantee of open opportunities for our children. 
Education is the key to success for them and for our country. 
I wish to avail myself of this occasion to thank all those who have given 
and are giving their contribution in this field. In particular I want to 
publicly thank all educators and teachers. With great dedication you are 
helping to bring out the best in our children. You are the principal 
builders of our country. For this, I thank you. 
I will now come to the point without further ado. In the education and 
training sector, we are estimating that for the forthcoming year we shall 
invest the global sum of more than Lm 121 million. We shall thus 
allocate Lm 12 million more than last year.  
Mr Speaker 
What does this mean?  This means that on average we shall invest Lm 
1,332 every year on every boy and girl, youth and adult within our 
educational system.  This average investment figure does not include 
related capital expenditure. 
41
Compulsory Education 
During next year we shall continue our project of building and 
modernising State schools. We are planning to complete the construction 
of two new secondary schools, one in Qormi and another in Cospicua. 
We shall start building new schools in Mosta, Pembroke and Gozo. We 
shall continue with the complete modernisation of the Boys’ Junior 
Lyceum in Hamrun. Various maintenance and modernisation works in 
different schools around Malta and Gozo will be undertaken. It is 
estimated that in 2007 Government will invest Lm 5 million on these 
projects under the financial arrangements scheme which the Foundation 
for Tomorrow’s Schools has set in place.  
Buildings alone are not sufficient. The discussions between the Ministry 
of Education and the Malta Union of Teachers have now reached their 
final stages. With pleasure I would like to report to the House the 
constructive and collaborative spirit between the two parties. We trust 
that we will reach an agreement that will strengthen the extensive reform 
taking place in the compulsory education sphere.  
We expect nothing bust the best education for our children.
We want State schools to have the most modern science laboratories for 
physics, chemistry, biology and technology, as well as language 
laboratories. Here we shall invest over Lm 1.5 million. In State schools, 
we shall have one hundred and three laboratories of the highest calibre, 
according to European Union standards. 
We consider Church and private schools as our principal partners in the 
education of our children. This belief leads us to two important 
programmes: 
First, this Budget is proposing an expenditure of Lm 12.75 million for 
Church Schools. This represents an increase of Lm 1 million over last 
year’s allocation. This means an average of Lm 755 for every boy and 
girl.
Second, we are aware of the expenses incurred by parents who decide to 
send their children to private schools. In 2003 we introduced a deduction 
from taxable income to make up for part of the fees paid. At that time we 
42
fixed a maximum of Lm 200 as deductible expenses for primary level 
students, and Lm 300 for secondary level. With effect from the 1st
January, Government will double these amounts to Lm 400 for primary 
level and Lm 600 for secondary level for every student.
Advanced and Higher Education 
We want to continue to strengthen the advanced and higher education 
sector.
Government shall make maximum use of EU funds allocated to Malta to 
continue strengthening the University and MCAST, two education pillars 
in our country. Next year we shall initiate a programme for construction, 
infrastructure and purchase of equipment spread over a number of years. 
For 2007, we are planning an expenditure of Lm 4.3 million and Lm4.5 
million respectively on these two institutions. In this way we will have 
the necessary space to allow number of students who pursue studies and 
training to continue increasing. At the same time they will have the 
required facilities and services to receive education and training. 
The recurrent expenditure for the coming year for the Institution of 
Advanced and Higher Education is estimated to reach the sum of Lm 
19.3 million. Government is increasing the recurrent grant to University 
by Lm700,000 to Lm 11.3 million. It is pertinent to remember that in 
addition to these funds, Government is investing almost Lm 9 million in 
direct student support in the form of stipends. 
We are again allocating the sum of Lm 200,000 for a number of 
scholarships at Masters and Doctorate level under the Malta Government 
Scholarship Scheme which we launched successfully this year.  
During pre-budget discussions we have met a number of students 
following private post-secondary courses or private university 
programmes on a full-time basis.  Government has decided that as of the 
2007 scholastic year, full-time students following higher education 
courses in private instutions will benefit from maintenance grants in 
accordance with recommendations to be made by the National 
Commission for Higher Education. We believe that the licensed private 
sector educational institutions are an asset to our country. This sector has 
an important role to play in developing Malta as a regional centre for 
training and educational services. 
43
We believe that we should never stop learning and training. We shall 
dedicate EU Funds for this purpose, or more specifically Lm 3.5 million 
from the European Social Fund. These include teaching and training 
courses for all parts of our society. 
In the sports sector Government is voting the global sum of Lm 1.1 
million. The capital vote of Lm 200,000 incorporates the continuation of 
the sports complex in Kirkop. In this contest it is worth mentioning that 
in addition to this investment Government is investing in sports facilities. 
Although these are based in Government schools, they are intended to be 
used after school hours also by sports organizations and those having a 
keen interest in sports. In this way we shall have a number of modern 
floodlit grounds with artificial turf, spread all over Malta and Gozo. This 
means that in addition to the ground in Kirkop, over the course of the 
next three years we shall have grounds of this standard in Qormi, 
Cospicua, Luqa, Mosta, Naxxar and Gozo. 
Mr Speaker, 
We have one aim - for our people to be among the best educated and 
trained people in the world. 
Generating Further Economic Growth and Job Creation 
I will now turn my attention to how we intend to generate further 
economic growth and ensure job creation. 
The euro 
Next year will be the year leading our country to another important step 
in its socio-economic development. In view of the economic progress 
which our country is registering, it seems more and more likely that the 
euro will be adopted on the 1st of January 2008.  Entry in the Euro zone, 
which boasts the second strongest currency in the world, should give 
greater stability to our economy. Thereafter, our country will become 
more attractive for those wishing to invest and create jobs in our country. 
The euro gave Europe stability not only by eliminating exchange rate 
risks between the participating countries, but also by creating a monetary 
environment characterised by low long-term interest rates. The euro has 
44
been conducive towards a monetary policy which has always favoured 
price stability.
Some still argue that our country should take more time before adopting 
the euro, without forwarding any plausible economic reasons. In this 
connection it is argued that our country should first concentrate on 
economic growth, while seemingly ignoring the fact the euro is an 
important tool for generating the desired economic growth. 
There are various risks associated with undue delays in adopting the 
euro. The countries which have not set this process in motion are already 
being considered as countries still having serious economic problems.  
We could be looked upon as lacking commitment towards a serious 
economic policy. To the contrary, I am proud to proclaim that today 
everyone considers us to be on track. 
Foreign Investment 
Our economy continued to develop and grow while made up for old 
economic structures which were no longer relevant for Malta. The 
measures we took yielded positive results. The record level of investment 
I mentioned earlier bears testimony to this fact. 
Over the past nine months, Malta Enterprise approved 71 new projects 
which over the next three years are set to create 3,600 new jobs and 
generate Lm44 million worth of investment. These figures relate only to 
those sectors which benefit from the incentives we are offering. The 
economy is however much larger than that. 
In order to continue sustaining and stimulating new investment in our 
country, in addition to the Lm2.3 million which are being allocated to 
Malta Enterprise in order to create aid schemes to industry, Government 
will allocate a further Lm1 million from EU funds for this purpose; 25 
per cent of these will be dedicated exclusively to Gozo. 
The time has come to depart from the present incentives structure under 
the Business Promotion Act. We need to adopt a flexible legal 
framework. During the course of the forthcoming year, we will be 
presenting these changes in our legal structures for discussion in 
Parliament.  
45
While on the subject of foreign investment, I cannot fail to mention the 
largest foreign investment this country has ever seen, namely the Smart 
City project in Ricasoli. Six years ago we had proclaimed our aspirations 
to transform Malta in the Mediterranean Information Technology capital. 
Back then, we were accused from some quarters that our vision was 
nothing but pie in the sky. These same detractors had proposed instead a 
future chained to the past whereby Malta would isolate itself from the 
rest of the world in order to protect traditional manufacturing industries 
such as textiles and leather products. It was these same detractors who 
vehemently opposed Malta’s entry in the European Union.  
Smart City alone represents more than Lm100 million worth of 
investment.  Thousands of Maltese citizens will earn their daily living 
from this investment. We should all feel very proud of this major asset 
which our country stands to gain. 
Government’s Strategy for Industry 
As I have already mentioned, today we are publishing Government’s 
Industrial Strategy for Malta. This strategy was drawn up following 
extensive consultation meetings held with various stakeholders, in 
particular the Federation of Industry.  We are certain that this strategy 
will be critical to further economic growth and employment opportunity.  
Information Technology 
Smart City was not a coincidence. The investors we persuaded to come to 
our shores had many other options where to base their European 
expansion project.
This year the European Union recognized the on-line public service 
provided by the Maltese Government as the second best in all Europe. 
The World Economic Forum reported that Government of Malta is the 
12th highest ranking Government in the world which uses technology to 
improve its level of services. This makes us competitive and improves 
the quality of life for all Maltese. 
Malta’s e-Government has reached yet another important stage. During 
the coming year a unique portal will be built with an investment of four 
hundred thousand Maltese liri. This will provide a one-stop shop for all 
electronic public services, and will constitute the highest level public 
service provided by any Government.   
46
We are now in the last three years of the National Strategic Plan for 
Information and Communications Technology which was launched in the 
beginning of 2003. Those who were sceptical back then, now have the 
perfect answer. Today our country boasts and impressive information 
society and economy.   
Over the course of the coming three years we shall be working towards a 
more ambitious National Strategic Plan for Technology.  I am convinced 
that within three years’ time, I will have the satisfaction to declare that 
our country is amongst the most technologically sophisticated in the 
world.
Research and Innovation 
If we want our country to be at the forefront amongst the more 
competitive countries and to attract the best investment, we have to 
strengthen our commitment towards research and innovation. 
As we announced in the National Strategy for Research and Innovation, 
which we published together with the Pre-Budget Document, 
Government is increasing public expenditure on research and innovation. 
This strategy proposes Lm1.25 million for the National Research and 
Innovation Programme. I am pleased to announce the fact that the 
allocation shall exceed this amount by Lm250,000, meaning a total of 
Lm1.5 million .   
In this connection I would like to mention the fact that Government has 
joined forces with the Malta Council for Science and Technology, Malta 
Enterprise, University and the private sector. This team has set up 
EuroMedITI, which identified and initiated a number of projects in the 
designated technological sectors.
Tourism
I have already stressed on the importance of the tourism industry in our 
country. Our country can attract more tourists if we are competitive, if 
we continue to invest in our product, if we can offer a unique positive 
experience to our visitors and if we understand that we all have a role to 
play in this industry. 
Government will not refrain from investing wherever necessary to ensure 
that this sector grows and improves tourist quality. Next year we will 
dedicate Lm 15 million towards this important sector to our economy. 
47
This amount represents an increase of almost 40 percent with respect to 
the approved budget for 2006. 
Next year Government will again allocate Lm 8 million directly to the 
Malta Tourism Authority. Apart from this amount we will allocate a 
further Lm 7.3 million towards improving our tourism product. This 
includes continuation of the Mnajdra and Hagar Qim Neolithic Temple 
projects, the development of new beaches and better management of 
existing ones, schemes to directly support the tourism industry, and the 
continuation of the branding exercise that also means additional 
marketing funds for the country. 
Government expenditure on the tourism product proper, including the 
heritage part of the product, will amount to Lm 5 million. 
To this I must also add the investment being made through other 
ministries to implement programmes and projects intended to 
considerably enhance our tourist product, which include the environment 
in general, road and countryside cleanliness, clean seas, clean air, 
embellishment of roads with trees, flowers and general landscaping, new 
high quality roads and rehabilitated village cores and squares. 
I will also add the value of the projects that we will finance through the 
consolidated fund and the EU funds to restore our heritage sites wherever 
necessary. This applies to all our heritage sites that are numerous in our 
country, including the unique fortifications of Malta and Gozo. 
We are doing all this because we firmly believe that we have a unique 
product which can face up to the harsh competition we face. We know 
that we have a lot to offer – a mix of a historical heritage and a rich 
culture, beautiful sea and natural coastline, and colourful villages and 
countryside. Apart from this Gozo offers more tourism product potential 
which adds value to the Maltese product. This is why we need to promote 
Gozo for what it is – a unique destination with special characteristics. 
Air Malta will remain a strategic asset to our country since the service it 
provides is in line with our national priorities and requirements, including 
those of industry.
Nevertheless, present day reality obliges us to expand our tourist 
channels. This is why earlier this year we took the first steps and 
introduced schemes to attract a low cost airline other than those already 
48
operating here. At this point it is pertinent to point out that these schemes 
will cost Government more than Lm 1 million. I am saying this to 
explain to everyone that the price of a low cost airline ticket is cheap 
because we are all paying part of it. 
In any case Government is convinced that this is the best direction to 
follow for our country. For this reason we will soon take the second step 
decided earlier this year, that is to promote the creation of new routes 
between Malta and new source markets in European countries. 
Over these last few days Government has received recommendations 
from the Consultative Council established a few weeks ago.  These 
recommendations will form an integral part of the National Tourism 
Plan. The intention is to start a new implementation phase within the 
shortest possible time frame. 
VAT exemption without credit on cultural activities 
Culture is an integral part of our national identity and an essential feature 
of the tourism package. We believe that the time has come to continue 
assisting the local artistic community by exempting without credit the 
VAT element of those services and activities of a cultural nature 
organised by recognised cultural non-profit organisations. 
This measure should encourage the provision and production of more 
cultural activity in places like Gozo so as to further enhance cultural and 
economic development in similar places. 
Host families 
A particular niche closely related to tourism which I would like to 
address in this Budget is that of host families. Earlier this year, we had 
announced an advantageous fiscal scheme for this service. We believe 
that we should go a step further by providing the option to these 
operators to obtain an exemption from social security contributions with 
retrospective effect. 
Financial Services 
Malta has already achieved important successes in the financial services 
sector. This year we estimate that around 2,500 companies will be added 
to the registry of companies. The total number of registered companies 
49
will reach the 40,000 mark. We also have eighteen banking institutions, 
more than 150 investment funds and eight insurance management 
companies. 
I am happy to note that earlier this year we have concluded an agreement 
with the European Commission that effectively safeguards the full tax 
imputation system. We are currently discussing the anti-abuse measures 
in our proposed tax system with the Code of Conduct (Business 
Taxation) Group. Government is expecting to conclude this political 
process forthwith. We will soon be publishing the necessary legislation to 
implement the agreement reached with the European Commission. 
Small and Medium-sized Enterprises 
We believe that the self employed and small enterprises constitute the 
heartbeat of our economy. Through all the initiatives announced in this 
Budget, we intend to generate more work for them in order to create new 
jobs.
An important measure we will be taking this year consists in enabling 
men or women working in a family business to register as employees of 
the same family business for fiscal purposes. This means that any man or 
woman working in their family business will be allowed to be registered 
on the company’s books, thus having the opportunity and advantage to 
enjoy all social benefits while also being entitled to a pension on 
payment of their Social Security contributions. For the family concerned 
this doesn’t only mean better recognition for their work, but above all the 
family business itself will benefit from a tax reduction.
We shall allocate Lm1.4 million, almost Lm 1 million more than the 
previous year, for the improvement of work places from which a number 
of self employed small enterprises operate. These Funds shall lead to the 
development of the Crafts Village in ta’ Qali under the stewardship of 
MCAST. We shall also continue the improvement programme in 
industrial zones for SMEs in �andaq, Imrie�el, �ebbu�, Mosta, Attard 
and Luqa.
This year we aim to reduce operating expenses for the self employed and 
owners of small enterprises. We intend to finalise amendments to the 
Trading Licences Regulations which allow for a lowering of trading 
licence fees while facilitating the process for issue of trading licences, by 
50
providing the necessary measures for such licences to be issued within a 
definite time frame. 
Venture Capital Fund 
Government is still committed towards the creation of a Venture Capital 
Fund. Following various attempts to operate this fund, we believe that the 
best way forward is for this Fund to be licensed as a Collective 
Investment Scheme under the auspices of the Malta Financial Services 
Authority. Government, through Malta Government Investments 
Limited, shall promote and assist the financing of this fund by 
contributing Lm900,000 of the initial capital.  
Port Reform 
Port Reform is of paramount importance in order to improve our 
country’s competitiveness. A new operator started working in Grand 
Harbour, discussions continued with all the parties involved.
We were well aware that we would be engaged in difficult negotiations 
which we entered for with the various port-related sectors. Discussions 
with port workers regressed slightly due to developments which were 
occurring within the General Workers Union. Now that the Malta 
Dockers’ Union and Union �addiema Mag�qudin have been recognized 
as the Unions which have a right to negotiate for their respective sectors, 
discussions have resumed.  
The ongoing discussions include the reorganization of port workers, the 
removal of outdated practices which are not adequate for a modern port 
and the lowering of tariffs for cargo handling.
Improving Regulation 
Improving regulation and cutting down on bureaucracy are essential for 
our business sector. Consequently, Government shall continue to insist 
that all kinds of regulation should be proportionate. Much has already 
been achieved in this field. We are still not satisfied and we want further 
improvement. We need to continue removing obstacles to business and 
the creation of wealth in this country.  
Table 14 illustrates the Plan of Action for Simplification drawn up by 
Government.  
51
Table 14: Plan of Action for Simplification
In order to achieve these aims, the Simplification Action Plan puts 
forward five main Government priorities with regards to Better 
Regulation, which are:- 
o
Setting up of a One-Stop-Shop Entity or Consolidation of Existing 
Entities. This strategic thrust aims at offering a range of 
Government services in an easy to get manner that saves businesses 
and citizens’ time and money by providing, a single, yet all 
inclusive point of access. Government entities also stand to gain by 
making better use of human and physical resources available.     
o
Revision of Procedures / Processes. Here, the attainment of better 
efficiency levels and customer service delivery in a number of areas 
are targeted with the aim of improving processing cycle times and 
throughput, without adversely impacting customer service.
o
Use of ICT and e-Government Services. This strategic thrust builds 
on Malta’s sterling attainments within ICT and information society 
and the main advantages of this thrust is that it saves businesses and 
citizens’ time and money by avoiding them having to go round in 
person to a number of entities and by improving clarity and 
accessibility of regulations. 
o
Simplifying legislation and repealing obsolete legislation. This 
strategic thrust intends to make legislation clear, understandable, 
up-to-date and user-friendly thus leading to better quality 
regulations.
o
Consolidation of forms. Complementary to the above strategic 
thrusts, these measures aim to remove excessive complexity, 
thereby making the Government-customer interface more simple 
and user-friendly, thereby improving service delivery to clients.
Over 100 proposals were identified for implementation of which more 
than 30 are deemed to be of high priority and around 20 proposals can be 
implemented in the immediate timeframe. Implementation of over 50 
projects has been targeted to commence immediately. In fact, the BRU 
has commenced with the implementation of this Plan.   
52
These proposals are anticipated to have an effect on the whole of society, 
albeit on different levels, as they deal with various aspects of everyday 
life such as the provision of health, education, business and social 
security services.   
Most of the projects we are implementing are anticipated to have far 
reaching effects. Examples of such projects include:- 
o
setting up a Business Facilitation Centre to provide preliminary 
information to business and to act as a one-stop-shop entity to 
facilitate all registration applications from business start-ups with a 
view to simplify the current burdensome, time-consuming, and 
unnecessary bureaucratic procedures to register a business; and 
o
introducing a single application form for the assessment for all social 
security and other benefits with a view to amalgamate the benefit 
application forms required, for example, for Social Assistance, Age 
Pension, Supplementary Allowance and Medical Assistance. 
Other proposals included in the plan would benefit particular sectors or 
target groups because of their specific nature. 
This is but a first yet fundamental step towards assisting our business in 
operating within a more competitive framework as well as to assist the 
citizen in gaining the most effective access to Government services in the 
easiest manner possible.   
In line with my Government’s policy on consultation, Government will 
be seeking to consult private, public and voluntary sector entities and 
individuals to gather their feedback. 
53
Gozo 
In the Pre-Budget document, Government published a socio-economic 
strategy for Gozo. This strategy emphasizes the need to sustain a distinct 
economy for this island, expanding its labour market, investing in 
education and research, and improving the quality of life for Gozitans.  
Mr Speaker, 
I am pleased to announce that Gozo’s Budget for the forthcoming year 
will increase by an additional Lm 2.4 million when compared to last 
year, taking the total allocation to approximately Lm 29 million. We 
believe that this investment will enable Gozo to continue developing as it 
deserves.
We are allocating a record sum of Lm9 million for capital projects in 
Gozo. One must not forget to add the Lm3 million invested in the 
building of new education complexes by the Foundation for Tomorrow’s 
Schools and Lm 3.3 for the sewage treatment plant. 
Table 15 sets out more detail on the projects that will be implemented in 
Gozo.
Table 15: Gozo Projects
Lm1.4 million will be allocated to tourism projects which will continue 
to strengthen Gozo’s image as a distinct destination. This includes the 
regeneration of the public garden at Villa Rundle, the coast in the vicinity 
of Mgarr Port with the development of ta’ �ewwieqa and development of 
bays. During the course of the forthcoming year Government will 
commission studies about the best possible preservation methods for The 
Citadel and the necessary interventions needed, while through Heritage 
Malta we will continue our project for the creation of a visitor’s centre 
and other works at Ggantija temples. During the coming year 
Government will start operating a training centre for the tourism industry, 
which Government is currently building in Qala. A crafts incubation 
centre will also start operating in G�ajnsielem. 
We will continue the programme for road improvements in residential 
areas that this year will have allocated over Lm500,000. We will use 
Lm2.1 million of EU funds to carry out extensive works on arterial roads 
54
that include the road to Xlendi, the road to Ta’ Pinu and Ramla.  As the 
studies to develop and alternative road to the Imgarr harbour are 
concluded, Government will be in a position to commence works on the 
bye-pass to Imgarr Harbour in line with the outcome of these studies. 
In the education sector, through the Foundation for Tomorrow’s Schools, 
we will start demolition works on the existing Junior Lyceum Complex 
and the Boys’ Secondary School to replace these with a modern school in 
line with current and future needs, equipped with sporting and 
underground parking facilities. At the same time we will offer new 
educational opportunities through specific programmes that address 
Gozo’s specific requirements. 
The modernisation programme of the Gozo General Hospital will 
continue through the modernisation of an operating theatre as well as the 
setting up of a radiology unit at a cost of Lm1 million. The 
decompression chamber will also commence operations. 
From an environmental perspective, the construction of the sewage 
treatment plant will continue and finish whilst work will commence on a 
waste transfer station requiring an investment of Lm1.5 million. The 
Dwejra management and the Qortin waste fill rehabilitation projects will 
continue with an investment of Lm750,000. 
Gozo should also benefit from the cruiseliners sector. To this end, the 
Maritime Authority will invest in berthing facilities for this sector. 
We realize the huge impact of seasonality on the Gozitan tourism market. 
We have therefore decided that as from the 1st of January, on renewal or 
issue of a new licence, accommodation and catering establishments in 
Gozo will pay 75 percent of the present rates.   
During 2006, Government has continued to identify further public 
services which can be transferred to the island of Gozo. The services 
identified include: the Freephone 153 service, payroll work related to 
public sector employees and Treasury pensions, work related to 
verification of Civil Status Certificates issued by the Public Registry. 
By the end of this year, we expect a number of the abovementioned 
services would have been transferred to Gozo. This means that about 
thirty Gozitan workers who work in Malta will be now be able to work in 
55
Gozo. This initiative will continue throughout next year with the overall 
aim that Gozitan workers in the general service grades of the public 
service will be employed in Gozo. Government’s vision is that all back-
office services required by the public administration will be carried out in 
Gozo. Government believes that Gozo provides an ideal environment for 
this kind of work and encourages the private sector to follow in 
Government’s footsteps.  
All this should help Gozo to have an economy built on the basis of its 
distinctiveness, strengthen education and training opportunities while 
leading to an improvement in quality of life.

Towards an All-Inclusive Society 
Health and Community Care 
Mr Speaker, 
Our country can boast a health service of the highest quality. All this is 
due to the dedication and commitment of the workers in this field, to the 
doctors, consultants, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, occupational 
therapists, social workers, medical laboratory technicians, other 
paramedics and support staff in this field. On behalf of the Maltese 
people I wish to thank them all. 
In order to secure our future, we must ensure that we shall continue to 
give the necessary priority to the level and quality of our health services. 
For this reason Government will continue to invest heavily in the health 
sector. It was truly interesting to note that a substantial number of 
questionnaires we received from the public in reaction to the pre-Budget 
Document, clearly revealed that the health sector should continue to 
receive the highest priority from Government. 
Within the next ten months, Government will inaugurate the largest 
project that a Maltese Government has ever embarked upon. In July 
2007, Skanska is bound to complete Mater Dei Hospital and hand it over 
to Government. This should allow Maltese people to start enjoying a 
quantum leap in health services. 
The number of interventions at St Luke’s is always on the increase. 
While during the year 2000 less than 25,000 interventions were 
performed, last year more than 32,000 interventions were performed 
which means an increase of 7000 interventions – an average of 20 
interventions per day. Notwithstanding this, Government wants to 
respond to the ever increasing demand from patients who are waiting for 
medical intervention. I wish to make it clear that here I am not referring 
to urgent interventions: these are always performed immediately. While 
we are investing in a hospital which will have more operating theatres, 
we have to admit that human resources in this sector are scarce. 
Therefore Government is working on a solution for the reduction of 
waiting time. 
57
We have taken these decisions in order to continue to improve our health 
services.
We shall build a rehabilitation facility of 280 beds in Luqa, near St 
Vincent Residence. This means that the number of beds will be four 
times more than what we have today. Our project also permits that 
patients who remain in hospital for rehabilitation purposes will be able to 
receive outpatient services while all the beds will be used to provide 
acute care. We shall transform Zammit Clapp Hospital to cater for 
Oncology and Dermatology services of the highest standard with an 
investment of Lm 3.5 million. The demand for cancer therapy is always 
on the increase and nowadays Boffa Hospital has become too small to 
cope. The new service will offer better facilities both to patients and to 
workers.
It is also time to make a new investment on medical equipment for 
Oncology. We shall invest heavily in the purchase of two linear 
accelerators which cost around Lm 2 million. 
A few days ago I had the pleasure of opening the complex of Madre 
Theresa at St Vincent which accommodates 108 elderly women. This is 
another confirmation of Government’s commitment towards the elderly 
population. This project, which cost Lm 3 million, is yet another step in a 
wide modernisation project which started a few years back.
Next year construction work will begin on the Residence for the Elderly 
at Mellieha on the basis of a ‘Public Private Partnership’. 
58
Personalised Social Services and the Disability Sector 
The social sector will remain the main pillar of Government’s policy. 
Next year expenditure on social benefits will reach a record of Lm243.3 
million. This is a sector which strengthens Maltese society and 
contributes indirectly to the economy. 
Mr Speaker, 
We cannot secure a future for our children unless we recognize the 
challenge in front of us of sustaining an adequate pensions system for 
future generations. The political convenience of procrastinating this 
problem is not in the interests of our youths. Government has presented 
to this Parliament a draft which envisages that a sustainable and adequate 
pensions system. I would like to express my gratitude to all those who 
have contributed in this direction so that next year we can initiate the 
implementation of this important reform.  
In addition to Government’s expenditure on social benefits, this Budget 
is providing approximately Lm 10 million to sustain personalised social 
services which support persons in difficult circumstances. Nowadays, the 
agencies Appo��, Sedqa and Sapport have become important tools so 
that Maltese society will provide professional support services to those 
needing them. 
Next year we shall initiate a number of other social programmes to 
address different needs. 
Government, in partnership with the Church, will open Pirotta Residence 
in Birkirkara as a community residence for persons with special needs.
Government is also initiating a programme for the fostering of children 
experiencing great difficulties. This service will build on the success 
which we accomplished in recent years with the fostering programme 
developed by the Agency Appo��.
In collaboration with the Local Council of Birkirkara, we shall develop a 
day-care centre for children named “�entru g�all-�arsien tat-Tfal Matul 
59
il-Jum”, which should serve as a model of how the Central Government 
and a Local Council can cooperate to provide this important service. 
Next year we shall also establish an Office for the Commissioner of 
Voluntary Organizations which should provide the legal and 
administrative framework for the further consolidation of this important 
sector. This framework will be an important tool for voluntary 
organizations to be able to participate in EU programmes. 
Next year will mark the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. 
This year should present us with the opportunity to focus on how Maltese 
society can continue along its path to ensure equal opportunities for all 
sectors of the Maltese society. 
These are a few of the important measures for which Government is 
allocating funds for the coming year, funding which will translate into 
services which value the most needy, so that no one will be left by the 
wayside.
The Housing Sector 
While Government continues to adopt a policy to encourage citizens, as 
far as possible, to own their own houses, Government is aware that there 
is a sector in society who cannot reach this aim without assistance. 
Therefore, Government’s policy in this sector is a dynamic one and seeks 
to address this area through different initiatives which vary from aid to 
young families about to buy their first house from the private market, to 
extensive programmes of lift installations in houses and apartments of 
elderly and disabled persons. 
During the course of this year, the Housing Authority offered 260 
properties for sale at a subsidised price at a cost in excess of Lm 1.6 
million. It also passed on around one hundred apartments to the 
Department of Social Accommodation to be allocated on lease. The 
Authority is planning to offer for sale more than another 450 properties 
during the course of next year. It will continue to work on Urban 
Regeneration projects in the localities of Valletta, Floriana, Msida and 
Cospicua.
This year, the Authority has launched two schemes to attract property in 
private ownership to the social accommodation market. 
60
The first scheme encourages owners who are interested to lease their 
property to the Housing Authority for a period of not less than ten years. 
Government intends to grant a favourable tax rate of 5% on income 
derived from such leases to those owners who are prepared to lease their 
property to the Authority for this purpose. 
Through the second scheme, the Authority buys properties from private 
owners which are either leased after being refurbished, or sold under the 
Shared Ownership Scheme. 
During the course of last year, the Housing Authority launched the first 
Shared Ownership Scheme with 132 properties. The aim of this scheme 
is to assist more persons to become house owners. Table 16 sets out more 
detail on this scheme. 
Table 16: Shared Ownership Scheme
This scheme provides that applicants who do not have the financial 
means to buy the entire property will be given the opportunity to buy a 
share in the property, with the possibility of buying the remaining share 
at a later stage. Through this scheme, Government is giving the 
opportunity to those who normally cannot afford to buy property to 
utilize the equivalent money which they normally pay for rent, to spend it 
to become owners of their houses. The market value of the properties 
under the first issue of the scheme amounted to over Lm 5 million. This 
shows how much this Government is committed in practice to invest in 
social accommodation for the most needy. 
During the pre-Budget discussions, we received very positive comments 
on this scheme. It appears that this scheme has helped a number of 
families who for a small margin could never become owners of their 
house and are now fulfilling their dream. As from next year, Government 
is extending this scheme to those who buy from the private sector. The 
Housing Authority will finance or guarantee a sum of between Lm 5,000 
and Lm 8,000 to couples and families who wish to buy their first house 
but who do not have the required collateral to obtain a Bank loan. 
Through this scheme we aim to help around 400 families to become 
owners of their house. 
61
Environment
Mr Speaker, 
This evening we shall reiterate our firm commitment in favour of the 
environment. We shall vote a total of Lm46.9 million for rural 
development and the environment, with the capital expenditure for 2007 
increasing by Lm5.8 million to Lm22.1 million. We shall also invest 
Lm28.1 million, an additional Lm5.8 million in comparison to the 
previous year on road works and projects which will continue to enhance 
the appearance and environment of our towns and villages. 
This amounts to a capital investment of Lm43.9 million or Lm11.6 
million more than last year. An investment to embellish the country we 
live in. 
Today, 17 percent of Maltese Land is regulated by law as Special Area of 
Conservation or Specially Protected Area. This amounts to more than 50 
km2 of land protected by law. This does not include the stretches of sea 
which are being placed under legal protection. This Government 
cherishes the historical heritage of our country, and shall accordingly 
invest Lm3.6 million in projects which further bring to light on the 
unique historical and architectural heritage of our country. This means 
that while the multitude of initiated projects will continue, we shall also 
set in motion new projects. To mention a few, these include work on 
Biblijoteka Nazzjonali, the Main Gate of Mdina, the conservation and 
restoration of the Old Church in Siggiewi, the aquaduct between St. 
Venera and Balzan and works in the centre of Qrendi, Luqa, �abbar and 
Xatt is-Sajjieda in Marsaxlokk, the Floriana mall and the Ta’ Xbiex 
promenade. 
Our country is renowned for its long stretches of bastions and 
fortifications; around 25 kilometres encapsulate the three cities, Valletta 
and Floriana, Mdina and the Citadel in Gozo. We have to halt the damage 
these are suffering while allowing their splendour to shine through. We 
have initiated projects that will cost tens of millions of Maltese liri, 
spread over a seven-year period. We are considering co-financing from 
the European Union for these projects. 
62
Together with the Lm 11.9 million allocated by Central Government, 
Local Councils will have the opportunity to participate in a number of 
programmes to which we will allocate Lm 1.8 million. Table 17 sets out 
this detail. 
Table 17: Local Community Embellishment Funds
Government wants its authorities to be committed towards the promotion 
of development in our localities. With this aim in mind, MEPA approved 
the allocation of just under Lm 1 million to various localities for urban 
improvement. Funds are allocated to the Urban Improvement Fund from 
approved planning applications which to not provide parking space and 
which are not covered by the Commuted Payment Parking Scheme. The 
money may be used for projects submitted by the central Government or 
Local Councils. Projects which MEPA deems eligible for the funds 
include; gardens, better traffic management schemes and facilities for 
disabled persons.
Another fund administrated by MEPA is the Environment Initiatives in 
Partnership Programme (EIPP). This is intended to help those 
communities which have suffered inconveniences due to a considerable 
amount of development in their locality. MEPA has concluded four 
projects thanks to EIPP funds. These were the restoration of St.Michael’s 
Chapel in Burmarrad, cleaning of the site in Tal-Baqqari, the restoration 
of the Victoria Lines in Ta’ Kaduma and the monitoring of artificial reefs 
close to il-Merkanti at Dragonara Point. Work is also in progress on eight 
other projects, including an educational documentary about the 
Mediterranean and 2 restoration projects in Gozo. 
Local Councils, together with NGOs, will be able to participate in 2 EU 
programmes in order to enhance the quality of life in their localities. We 
shall allocate Lm500,000 from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural 
Development as well as Lm300,000 from the European Regional 
Development Fund.  
63
Waste management 
WasteServ has been allocated Lm3.5 million in co-financing under the 
Structural Funds of the European Regional Development Fund, for 
rehabilitation of the closed landfills in Mag�tab, Qortin and Wied Fulija. 
We are at an advanced stage in the rehabilitation of the Maghtab landfill. 
The engineered landfill in Ta’ Zwejra took up around 600,000 tons of 
waste. Now that this has been filled, Government is investing Lm10 
million on the development of a new engineered landfill in Ghallis. It is 
estimated that this facility for domestic waste will be filled at a rate of 
250,000 tonnes of waste per year for a period of not less than 7 years. 
WasteServ is at a very advanced stage in order to start operating the 5 
Recycling Centres for Bulky Waste and as from next month, the first two 
centres in Maghtab and Mriehel will be open for public use. These 
centres will make it easy for one to dispose bulky waste once it is 
separated.
The development of these sites is part of a project that also includes the 
introduction of more bring-in sites and an ongoing information 
campaign. All this is being done through co-financing from the European 
Regional Development Fund to the tune of almost Lm 2 million.  
Other new initiatives include a family park next to sant Antnin, tree 
planting and an animal centre. Table 18 sets out more detail on the 
projects that will be implemented.. 
Table 18: Family Park adjacent to Sant’Antnin
A Project Description Statement has been submitted to MEPA for the 
construction a Family Park in Marsascala adjacent to Sant’Antnin plant. 
The site chosen until now has been neglected to date and was used as a 
dump. Thanks to this family park we will enhance the characteristics of 
the natural environment in Wied il-G�ajn.
Afforestation 
Following the success of the 34U campaign, Government will continue 
giving its contribution for the planting of more trees in our country. Next 
year’s aim will be more extensive, and with the public’s help 5 zones will 
be developed around Malta. We shall double the aim for next year to 
64
20,000 trees. Although many of these trees are being donated by the 
public, on its part Government is taking care of the required 
infrastructure, including the building of rubble walls, reservoirs and 
irrigation systems, as well as maintenance work. In order for Government 
to keep up his contribution, the vote for purpose shall increase to 
Lm150,000. 
Animal Welfare 
Government is working to set up a foundation for animal care. The scope 
of the foundation includes management of the National Centre for 
Animal Care which will be set up by Government. This centre will 
embrace a number of modern facilities which includes an after-care clinic 
and boarding kennels. For this aim Government is voting Lm 60,000 so 
that in work on this centre will commence in 2007. 
Programme for Rural Development 
Under the present programme for Rural Development 2004-2006, there 
are a number of measures which will be carried over for a number of 
years to the next programme. These consist in agri-environmental 
measures and include the building of rubble walls and organic farming. 
For these measures the projected expenditure for 2007 amounts to 
approximately Lm1.5 million. Furthermore, there are also aids under the 
Structural Funds for investment in agricultural structures and 
improvement of processing. Expenditure for the year 2007 under these 
two measures will amount to Lm1.44 million. Consequently, the total 
expenditure on rural development for 2007 is projected to reach around 
Lm2.94 million. 
In the year 2007, the new programme for rural development 2007 - 2013 
also enters into force. Under this programme, which is currently in the 
preparation stages, we are projecting an expenditure of around Lm2.4 
million for the 2007. Lm 2 million from this total sum consists in aids to 
farmers and producers to strengthen their competitiveness while attaining 
quality, health and environmental protection standard. The rest of the 
funds shall be allocated to investment projects within rural zones which 
that embellish and preserve the natural and rural environment.  
65
Fisheries
In the fisheries sector, the main priorities shall be to further improve the 
facilities for fishermen in the ports of Malta and Gozo, measures which 
strengthen production from fish farms, the reallocation of fish markets as 
well as aid for the modernization and improvement of fishing vessels. 
These projects, in conjunction with others, will be partially financed by 
the European Union.  Lm 1.9 million are being allocated for this purpose. 
Roads
We have bolstered the roads network in Malta and Gozo. Thanks to funds 
derived from the fifth financial protocol between Malta and Italy and EU 
funds, the average expenditure on road works in Malta and Gozo during 
the last 3 years has risen to more than Lm 15 million per year.  
The positive effects of these works are already being felt. It is planned 
that the rhythm of this work will be kept up during the coming years. The 
challenges of carrying out works to the highest quality standards and 
within the stipulated timeframes are being met successfully. The 
remaining challenge is that of executing these works with the least 
inconvenience possible for road-users and residents nearby. 
From 2003 onwards, 379 new residential roads were built in 46 locations 
in Malta whilst in Gozo, another programme is being coordinated by the 
Ministry for Gozo and the ADT.  The rhythm picked up in the past 5 
years has substantially decreased the list of roads still requiring works. 
Government has compiled a list of these roads. We have identified 
around 450 residential streets which will be built by the Central 
Government by end 2008. The estimated cost for these roads, with a 
length of 55 kilometres, exceeds Lm8 million. Calls for tenders have 
already been issued for the commencement of work on 80 of these roads. 
In the coming months Government shall issue a call for tenders, for 
arterial roads projects, to be financed by the European Union. These 
include the upgrading of the road connecting 13th December Street in 
Marsa to the Cruise Passenger Terminal, and the upgrading of Council of 
Europe street in Luqa. It is planned that by the end of next year, we will 
have completed Lm13 million worth of projects in arterial roads 
development. 
66
European Union Funds 
Our country’s experience in use of EU funds has been a positive one and 
augurs well for the future.
Mr Speaker, 
During the forthcoming year, we will be facing massive challenges in 
this sphere!   We have at our disposal much more EU funds than we have 
had to date. Indeed, we have four times more per year.  Under this new 
Budget, Malta receive have an average of Lm50.4 million annually in 
Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds alone.  These in addition to an 
extra Lm33.6 million under the Agricultural and Rural Development 
Fund, and the Fisheries Fund during this financing period.  These figures 
look good on the eye but require much work and discipline in order to be 
converted to benefits for our country. 
Government has drawn up the strategy and draft Programmes which are 
currently being negotiated in an informal manner with the European 
Commission. It is Government’s aim to start applying these Funds to 
projects as from early next year.   
Government’s strategy for using these Funds is built on a number of 
aims. These include the improving our country’s competitiveness and the 
standard of living of Maltese and Gozitan citizens, while addressing 
Gozo’s special needs. These aims give rise to a number of priorities, 
including education and training, employment and social inclusion, 
research and innovation, tourism, historical heritage, industry, 
environment, transport and renewable energy. These are priorities which 
also emerged from discussions I had earlier this year. I can confirm that 
there is also an agreement in principle with the European Commission on 
these priorities and we are now expecting to start formal negotiations.  
Once an agreement is reached on these programmes, the projects may 
commence. Contemporaneously we are also preparing strategies for the 
agricultural, rural development and fisheries sectors.   
I am convinced that the Maltese and Gozitan population together with the 
public administration will live up to this commitment with the same level 
of determination and perseverance shown by everyone in the 
implementation of the present Programme. I trust that we will achieve the 
same result.   
67
Incentives to Generate Employment, Stimulate Economic 
Growth and Other Measures 
Mr Speaker, 
In the beginning of my speech, I declared that the aim of this year’s 
Budget is to secure our children’s future. One of the ways how this can 
be achieved is by generating employment and stimulating economic 
growth. We will therefore propose a number of measures, specifically 
aimed towards the achievement of such goals. 
I would like to emphasize that in the measures to be announced, 
Government is acting responsibly and taking decisions following a 
detailed analysis of projected revenue for the coming years. I would also 
like to add that the measures being proposed in this budget should have a 
positive economic impact, for instance an increased female participation 
rate in the labour market, more productive workers and reduced burdens 
for the self-employed.
It is a fact that we are managing to curtail recurrent expenditure without 
failing our social obligations. Furthermore, Government revenue is 
consistently meeting the targets established towards the beginning of 
each year, without tax increases.  
We are convinced that this will achieved once again in the forthcoming 
year and in the following years. The economic growth we are registering 
clearly shows that the increase in revenue we are seeing is generated by 
increased economic activity and not through tax rises. 
I am therefore pleased to announce that for the second consecutive year, 
we have managed to present a Budget without new taxes, and indeed 
without any rises in existing taxes. 
Moreover, this year we shall start taking the first steps to alleviate the tax 
burden, where this is possible. 
Energy Benefit and Incentives for Energy Conservation 
As I stated in the beginning of my speech, Government is aware of the 
pressure imposed by oil prices on Maltese and Gozitan families. With 
full responsibility, we reiterate that if some relief is to be granted, this 
68
should be in the form of a raise in our families’ income and not in the 
form of a subsidy on the surcharge. Otherwise, we would be 
discriminating against those who are conscientious about the need not to 
waste, and who use energy in a responsible manner. Government shall 
however introduce an energy-related benefit for those categories in our 
society who need our solidarity.
In order to alleviate the burden on families caught up in a difficult 
financial situation, we shall introduce the energy benefit.  Families 
eligible for non-contributory benefits, which amount to approximately 
17,000 families, will benefit from this aid. The benefit will be calculated 
in such a way to neutralise the surcharge impact on the basis of average 
consumption, according to the number of beneficiaries. This will be 
awarded in the form of a voucher redeemable on payment of the water 
and electricity bill of such family. 
We need to implement measures that encourage more efficient energy 
use.  As of the 1st November we will offer assistance up to a 20 percent 
of the purchase price, capped at Lm50, on washing machines, tumble 
dryers, refrigerators, freezers and airconditioning equipment for domestic 
use, that are certified as being energy efficient. This will be in 
accordance with the provisions of Legal Notice 99 or 2002. 
Change in Computation System of Social Security Contributions on 
Part-Time Employment 
Part-time employment as a main employment has become a common 
characteristic of the Maltese economy. For this reason, Government has 
decided to adjust the social security contribution paid by part-time 
employees for whom such employment is their main job. 
To date, part-time employees who work more than eight hours per week, 
regardless of the amount earned, are obliged to pay a minimum 
contribution of Lm5.79 per week, which is equivalent to 10 per cent of 
the National Minimum Wage. In view of this system, many are those 
who wish to work on a part-time basis but are dissuaded from doing so. 
In order to address the difficulties encountered by part-time workers, in 
this Budget the Government has decided that as from the 1st of January 
2007, the social security contributions due by employees working eight 
69
hours or less shall be adjusted to 10 per cent of what they earn from such 
work.
This pro-rata rate of social contributions gives the contributor a pro-rata
entitlement 
to 
contributory 
benefits. 
Through 
these 
measures, 
Government is alleviating the burden on workers and strengthening the 
part-time work sector. It is calculated that this measure will signify a loss 
of approximately Lm 1 million in Government revenue. 
Government considers this measure to be yet another step in the required 
reform in order to make part-time work more attractive. The next 
discussions on the agenda concern the social security contributions to be 
paid by employers who provide work to part-timers. This discussion must 
take into account the duties of employers who employ workers for an 8 to 
19-hour week.
Measures to help the family in its responsibilities 
Government is well aware that more and more women and men are 
choosing to seek employment. This choice presents new challenges for 
the family, which must fulfil its duties as a family, while balancing these 
duties with work responsibilities. In this Budget, Government shall adopt 
a number of measures which help the family in the fulfilment of its 
responsibilities.
First, Government decided to extend those measures in favour of the 
family applicable to the Civil Service to the entire Public Sector. This 
measure shall benefit around thirteen thousand Public Sector employees. 
Second, Government shall allow parents to deduct Lm400 from the 
taxable amount to make good for part of the expenses incurred in 
licenced childcare services. 
Third, in those cases where employers pay their employees for expenses 
related to childcare services, such expenses are considered as business 
costs and therefore are deductible from taxable income. 
Fourth, in those cases were employees receive payment from their 
employer for expenses related to childcare services, such payments shall 
no longer be considered as fringe benefits in the hands of the employee 
and will therefore no longer be taxable. 
70
Together with these measures, Government shall continue helping, 
through funds and technical advice, existent child care services to 
improve their operations. Various other programmes having the same 
aim and financed under the European Social Fund shall also be 
continued.
Revision of Tax Bands 
The study carried out by the Tax Revision Commission clearly showed 
that Government should not change tax rates. However, Government 
should consider how to adjust tax bands in order to provide a greater 
incentive to those who want to work harder.
Following a detailed analysis, we have decided to change the present tax 
bands in order to incentivise those who wish to work. The main aim 
behind this change is to reduce the current disincentive for those who 
want to work harder. To date, we have a situation where some persons 
refuse to do overtime on the basis of the belief that they would be taxed 
at a higher rate than if they do part-time work at the 15 per cent rate.   
This change will amount to a loss of approximately Lm12 million in 
Government revenue from income tax.   
Tables 19 and 20 show the new bands for a joint declaration and single 
declaration respectively:

Through the changes I am announcing today, in case of joint 
computation, the non-taxable amount under the first band will increase 
by Lm200 to Lm4,500. In order to truly incentivise those who want to 
work harder, the band of income taxed at 15 per cent shall be extended 
by Lm2,000, that is from Lm6,000 to Lm8,000; the 20 per cent band has 
thus been removed. The 25 per cent band shall be raised by Lm750 and is 
thus extended to Lm10,000. The 30 per cent has therefore also been 
removed.   
A couple which does not earn more than Lm8,000 annually, shall benefit 
from an income tax reduction of up to Lm 168 annually, thanks to this 
reform. If this couple earns between Lm8,000 and Lm10,000, it will 
benefit from a tax reduction ranging from Lm168 to Lm243 annually. 
In case of separate computation, the non-taxable amount shall increase by 
Lm150, thereby increasing to Lm3,250. In order to give a genuine 
incentive to those who wish to work harder, the 15 per cent tax band shall 
be extended by Lm1,400, thus taking it up to Lm5,500. The 20 per cent 
band has been removed. The 25 per cent tax band shall increase by 
Lm1,750, and has thus been extended to Lm6,750. The 30 per cent tax 
band has been removed. 
A single person earning between Lm4,500 and Lm5,500 annually will 
save between Lm 43 and Lm 118 on income tax.  Those earning between 
Lm5,500 and Lm7,000 will save between Lm118 and Lm143 per year. 
This means that couples who in aggregate earn between Lm11,000 and 
72
Lm14,000, and who choose a separate computation, will save between 
Lm236 and Lm286. 
The message is clear. Government believes that an average tax of 
between 15 per cent up to a maximum of 25 per cent is a reasonable 
contribution for the country’s financial requirements. It is not excluded 
that if financial objectives continue being attained and the economy 
reacts positively to this measure, Government will continue with this 
reform and start applying the 35 per cent rate at a higher ceiling than 
present.
In the changes we are effecting to the bands of those who opt for a 
separate computation and single persons, the reform aims to reach the 
same goal, namely that of providing an incentive to those who want to 
work harder. 
Tables 21 and 22 indicate the positive impact of the new bands.

We also decided that payment of tax refunds owed by the Inland 
Revenue Department to various individuals and companies for previous 
years will no longer be postponed indefinitely. The amounts due shall be 
paid in the stipulated time frame. The average period envisaged will be of 
12 months, going up to a maximum of 36 months where amounts are 
substantial. The Department shall also bind itself to pay interest at the 
rate of 1 per cent monthly. This constitutes another step so that those 
paying extra tax will no longer be left in the dark. 
Supplementary Aid 
With effect from the 1st of January 2007, Government is increasing the 
supplementary benefit aid both for married couples as well as for single 
persons. This benefit provides additional income for those low-earners 
who do not benefit from children’s allowance. For married couples, this 
benefit will increase by a minimum of Lm 15 annually and a maximum 
of Lm 20 annually, according to the couple’s income. For single persons, 
this benefit shall increase with a minimum of Lm12.50 annually and a 
maximum of Lm15 annually, always according to the person’s income. It 
is estimated that this adjustment represents an increase of Lm250,000 
annually for the benefit for 2007. 
74
Air Departure Tax 
On attainment of our financial targets, and in the context of the tax 
measures I have just announced, as from the 1st of June 2007 we shall 
remove the Lm10 from the air departure tax which we had introduced in 
August last year.
Severe Disability Pension 
In the Budget announced two years ago, we had introduced a measure 
whereby when two disabled persons eligible for a severe disability 
pension get married, they do not lose this benefit. I can personally vouch 
for the fact that this measure has already made a difference in people’s 
lives. We shall now take a further step in this direction: a disabled person 
in receipt of a severe disability pension and who gets married to a person 
who is not disabled does not lose this pension in view of the income of 
his/her spouse during the first five years of marriage. Through this 
measure, the severe disability pension shall continue to be of financial 
aid to the persons concerned in the first five years of marriage. 
Widows’/Widowers’ Pension 
During the widespread consultation carried out prior to this Budget, I had 
the fortune of coming across two cases of widows who explained to me 
how the Budget can be of help to them. A widow with three children who 
have completed secondary education explained to me that she was 
feeling compelled to reduce her working hours in order to earn more than 
the minimum wage, as otherwise she would lose her entitlement to the 
widow’s pension. This happened at a time when her children’s expenses 
were constantly increasing as they got older. Another widow spoke to me 
about the fact that she wished to remarry but would lose her pension on 
getting remarried.  The Government listened to these stories and decided 
to arrange this situation in this Budget. As from the 1st of January 2007, 
a widow or widower entitled to a widows’/widowers’ pension will 
remain so entitled to the fixed rate of this pension when they earn more 
than the minimum wage and in the first five years of marriage.  
Duty on Documents and Transfers 
We shall amend the duty on documents and transfers as explained in 
Table 23, in order to help couples when they inherit from each other. 
75
Table 23
To date, when a person inherits property which was the residence 
of the transferor, the first Lm10,000 of the value of the property 
are exempt from tax. We are now extending this value to 
Lm15,000. 
At the same time, if the person inheriting the property as 
mentioned above resides with the transferor, this person pays the 
reduced rate of 3.5 per cent, instead of 5 per cent on the value in 
excess of Lm10,000. This beneficial rate of 3.5 per cent now 
applies on the value in excess of Lm15,000. 
Another rule stipulates that when a person resides in a tenement 
he/she inherits, and in which the transferor does not reside, the 
first Lm20,000 of the value of the property attracts the beneficial 
rate of 3.5 per cent instead of 5 per cent. This Lm20,000 shall be 
extended to Lm30,000 of the value of the property. 
Securitisation
A considerable amount of people have been waiting for many years to 
receive compensation from Government following expropriation of their 
land. Government, through the law on Securitisation, as explained in 
Table 24, shall set up a fund worth Lm20 million in order to settle these 
due amounts faster. 
Table 24:  Property Fund
We have a substantial amount of people who are still awaiting 
compensation for land expropriated from them from Government 
for public purposes.
Today, the law on Securitisation is offering a new opportunity for 
Government to honour its duties much faster than if we continue 
following the practices of these past few years.  
It is worth mentioning that provisions have already been made for 
these creditors throughout the years, and consequently, what I am 
proposing in this Budget will have no impact on Government 
revenue, since this should only be considered as financing in 
76
accordance with rules established by the 1995 European System 
of Accounts (ESA). 
During the forthcoming year, Government shall place a number 
of its properties under this fund, which shall be administered by a 
financial institution to be chosen following the issue of a call for 
tenders, and which shall be listed on the Maltese Stock Exchange.
This Fund will offer to these Government creditors bonds having 
a ten-year maturity period and bearing interest. The biggest 
advantage of this scheme is that whoever wants to liquidate this 
investment or use it as collateral to obtain a bank loan, will be 
able to do so either by trading these bonds on the Malta Stock 
Exchange, or else by using these bonds to secure a loan. 
Participation in these bonds will take place by offer, however 
creditors owed money by Government due to property 
expropriated will be given priority, with first preference being 
given to the hundreds of small owners who have been waiting for 
the compensation due for many years.  
The document establishing this fund, which is estimated to have a 
value of Lm20 million,  will bind the financial institution with 
procedures 
concerning 
transparency 
and 
accountability, 
stipulating the manner in which property comprising the fund 
may be transferred, its payment obligations, annual interest to 
bond holders and the capital on maturity of bonds after the ten-
year period.
Compensation for Cost of Living 
This year’s increase for cost of living, calculated on the basis of the rate 
of inflation in accordance with the Retail Price index, shall be of Lm2.25 
per week.
This time last year we were experiencing special circumstances caused 
by a steep rise in oil prices. Back then we had forecast that in view these 
exceptional circumstances, the cost of living for this year would be 
somewhat higher. In order to make good for this increase, in last year’s 
Budget, Government had granted 50 cents from the compensation for 
cost of living for this year in advance.
77
Our Vision Forward  
Mr Speaker. 
This budget, like the previous budget, does not envisage new taxes of 
increases in tax rates. It takes a further step forward in adjusting income 
tax to reward work effort. It is a budget that strengthens female 
participation in the workplace. It is a budget to benefit all Maltese 
families. 
When we say that together we want to build a secure future for our 
children, we are not talking about something in the far distance.  
The future begins today because it is nurtured by what we do or do not 
do, as from today. We cannot brush the problems we face today under the 
carpet and leave them unresolved, saying that we have enough time. 
Government insisted that we face the pensions problem today so that our 
children will not be faced with a crisis tomorrow.  
This is the serious governance the Maltese people expect.
The Budget which I have presented today is the cornerstone on which we 
can build a secure future. Every measure we are taking is analysed in the 
light of: To what extent does it help to give us a good present, and a 
better future? 
The world in which our children will live within the next ten, fifteen, 
twenty years will be different from the world we live in now. Exactly 
how it will be, we do not know. It depends a lot on today. But in the 
sketches being drawn up today, we can already catch a glimpse of 
tomorrow’s picture, which is currently being nurtured.  
We will have a world increasingly dominated by information technology, 
We have to ensure that technology is serving man and not vice versa. 
Technology must be designed in image of man, and not man in the image 
of technology. The heavy investment that we are making in the education 
of our children should give them the key to open the door to the future, to 
overcome and not be overcome by the possibilities which this world will 
offer.
78
We have to ensure that those amongst our children, who for some reason 
or other may not be able to master these new possibilities, are not 
excluded from society and fall by the wayside. These are also our 
children, and we must value them and must not jeopardise their dignity. 
They too must be able to fulfil their aspirations in life. 
In tomorrow’s world society will remain more important than the State. 
In this society therefore, more and more importance and power should be 
given to non-governmental organizations which form part of civil 
society. We have to find a way of empowering these organisations so that 
together with the organs of the state we create a society built on a 
communication web which our children truly deserve and which satisfies 
their needs and various capabilities. 
In building a secure future for our children, there is also an important 
place for those who do not agree with our policy direction. The 
discussion for alternative solutions alternative solutions to actions 
undertaken by Government as well as those proposed in this budget, 
strengthens our children’s future. There are areas which are not 
absolutely crucial to agree on, but there are other matters which are vital 
everyone agrees on, including the Opposition, and that everyone tows the 
same line.  I believe that our people want a situation where we will work 
more closely together. It is essential that we work closer together in order 
to secure the future of our children.
We are all one family and it is as one family that we may grow in 
strength.
One final word - our children will have a secure future, if we, the Maltese 
and Gozitans of today, have faith in ourselves and our abilities. Together 
we have already made significant inroads and won many a challenge. 
Together we can build a better future for us and a secure future for our 
children.
