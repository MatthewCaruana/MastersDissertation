1. Introduction 
Mr. Speaker 
We can only overcome the financial crisis around us through 
good governance and responsibility. This is the message 
contained in the budget speech that I am presenting in front of 
this House. 
Throughout the past three years we have faced major turmoil. It 
was only by being cautious, by taking difficult yet good 
decisions and through the work, industry and sacrifice of all 
our families that we kept our country moving forward, despite 
the crisis going on around us. 
It is not a coincidence that we were not overwhelmed and that 
we managed to maintain our standard of living. 
There is a price to pay for everything. We took the difficult yet 
responsible path. We chose what we deemed best for Malta and 
Gozo’s families, even when we had to make hard choices. 
Unlike others, we did not lose time in fancy words but set our 
sights on the long-term future.  
Our country cannot ignore the enormous crisis in Europe and 
the rest of the world. We cannot control outside events. It is 
only the choices that we are making together that are sustaining 
our families in the worst moments of the crisis that we are 
going through.  
What we did was achieved through a collective effort, and it is 
only through a collective effort that we can weather the storm.

The Government’s strategy is to safeguard employment, to 
incentivise investment, to develop the economy, to invest 
strongly in education, to keep the tax burden low, to fight 
inflation, to reduce bureaucracy, to strengthen pensions and 
social benefits, to support the neediest families and to continue 
to invest in the development of health services. This strategy is 
bearing fruit, because we believe that economic policy and 
social policy are inextricably linked even in times of crisis.   
Mr. Speaker 
This Budget will continues to build on this strategy. Through 
this budget, we want to:  
1. ensure the macro-economic stability and financial 
sustainability needed to continue to attract investment, 
create jobs and sustain the social framework; 
2. invest wisely in initiatives that develop the economic 
activity of our country and create more and better 
employment; 
3. sustain the extensive programme of investment in 
infrastructure, the energy sector and the environment;  
4. invest more in education and training; and   
5. ensure that, despite the challenges that we will have to 
face, it will be a budget that satisfies the needs of the 
families, the elderly, and the most vulnerable strata of 
society. 
Mr. Speaker 
This Budget reflects the professionalism, the credibilty and the 
responsibility which our country needs in order to overcome 
 
3 
the challenges around us. This is a budget which will foster 
trust in our country and provide faith in our ability to 
overcome adversity.   
2. The Maltese economy and the international 
situation 
Mr. Speaker  
Everyone is aware of the events taking place around us. Several 
international agencies, including the European Commission, 
are revising downwards the forecast for economic growth in 
Europe. The critical state of Greece; a very worrying situation in 
Italy; Spain, Portugal, Ireland, England, and France are 
adopting austerity measures which are leaving an impact on 
their people and the European economy. 
The European Union is working relentlessly to control the 
negative impact of the financial crisis. It is in the interest of us 
all to overcome this crisis because that is the only way that the 
real economy, on which our livelihood depends, can continue 
to function at a good pace and create prosperity and 
employment. 
Mr. Speaker 
These historic events have hit us hard.  
While it is essential to maintain solidarity with our friends, 
especially in the Euro Zone, we have to protect and provide 
direction for our country in the international crisis. We want an 
economic policy based on sound foundations and sustainable 
finances.

2.1 The financial situation 
While our deficit and debt levels are low when compared to 
those of our partners in the European Union, our country is still 
in an excessive deficit procedure. We remain committed to 
lowering our country’s deficit to 181.7 million euro by the end 
of this year, or 2.8 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product. 
For 2012, we forecast a deficit of 2.3 percent of the Gross 
Domestic Product. This should lead to Malta’s exit from the 
European Union’s excessive deficit procedure, will send an 
important signal of reassurance to potential investors, will 
generate employment and provide the fiscal space needed in 
order to intervene as needed in the economy throughout 2012.  
The income from direct and indirect taxation is expected to be 
2.5 billion euro, while 419.2 million euro comes from other 
sources of income.  
The recurrent expenditure is expected to increase only by 92.6 
million euro over that forecast for 2011.  
The capital investment in Malta and Gozo’s economy is 
expected to be 425.3 million euro.  
The Government’s debt is expected to be 68.9 per cent of Gross 
Domestic Product. 
More details may be found in the tables number 2.1 to 2.3 and 
in Appendix A attached to this speech.  
Mr. Speaker  
In the ongoing crisis, economic growth depends on economic 
stability and not vice-versa. In an small and open economy such 
as ours, which depends on foreign investment in order to 
sustain 
employment 
levels, 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
Government’s finances is of utmost importance.

2.2 What 
is 
our 
country’s 
distinguishing 
characteristic?  
The employment situation in Malta has remained strong. 
Indeed, in certain aspects it even grew stronger.  
In the first months of this year, employment increased by more 
than 2.5 per cent, which compares very well to a growth of 
approximately 1 per cent in the Euro Zone. Since the start of the 
crisis, only five countries have increased their employment rate: 
Malta was among them. One should also note the significant 
increase in women’s participation in the employment market. 
This success was crucial for our country’s financial stability in 
these difficult times and as well as the improvement of our 
families’ economic and social standards.

Mr. Speaker 
This did not happen by chance. This is the result of a clear 
economic policy which protects employment. It is also the 
result of the work of our social partners who recognised the 
challenges being presented by these difficult times. On behalf of 
the Government, I wish to express my gratitude. 
Mr. Speaker 
The competitiveness of Maltese industry and enterprise is a 
crucial consideration. In this year’s first semester, our Gross 
Domestic Product increased by 2.6 per cent in real terms.  
Tourism was also very successful throughout this year, with 
substantial growth which benefited other sectors such as the 
restaurant and accommodation sectors as well as the retail and 
the transport sectors.  
Among the sectors which had a good turnout this year are 
professional, technical and scientific services. They offer 
services to other areas of the economy, such as the financial 
sector.  
We must maintain this success by addressing our economic, 
social and environmental challenges. They were identified in an 
exercise we carried out in the context of the European Semester:  
1. Sustainable finances with a reduction in the fiscal deficit 
and public debt in accordance with the Stability and 
Growth Pact as well as strengthening the fiscal 
governance;  
2. Reforms in the pension system in order to ensure 
sustainability; 
 
9 
3. An education system which serves the needs of the 
economy, especially tertiary and vocational education, 
and a reduction in the rate of student dropout for 16-year 
olds and above; 
4. Studies and reforms, together with the social partners, of 
the systems of distribution of wages and salaries to 
improve competitiveness in the Maltese economy; and  
5. Reduced dependence on oil by investment in clean 
energy and the promotion of more efficient energy use.  
Together with these economic challenges, the Maltese 
Government commits itself to creating the best environment 
for:  
 better use of human resources, with greater participation 
in the labour market, and investment in the educational 
system;  
 more investment in the Maltese economy, including 
capital investment by the Government and the utilisation 
of European funds;  
 an industrial policy which makes better use of the most 
competitive resources of the country and which exploits 
markets adapted to the areas of our economy which 
show most potential, including manufacture, tourism, 
science, 
research 
and 
innovation, 
financial 
and 
commercial services, information technology, culture and 
creativity and the environment; 
 a strong financial system; and 
 more efficient markets and fair prices.  
 
10 
The rate of inflation during the 12 months up to September 
showed an upward trend reaching 2.7 percent. In 2012, 
economic growth in Malta is expected to be approximately 2.3 
per cent. Inflation is expected to reach 2.1 per cent. I table a 
copy of the Economic Survey which provides a detailed view of 
the economic situation of our country. 
The cost-of-living increase, calculated in accordance with the 
mechanism agreed with the social partners, will consist of €4.66 
per week. 
 
3. Employment, Enterprise, Tourism 
Mr. Speaker 
We have set employment as the Government’s main priority. 
Notwithstanding the current crisis, we have continued to 
reduce 
unemployment 
throughout 
this 
year. 
Current 
unemployment stands at 6.6%, 3.1% less than the European 
Union average. We created more jobs in all the country’s 
economic sectors, and thus our country’s economy sustained its 
growth.  
3.1 Industry and economic growth  
Mr. Speaker 
Investment by the private sector is crucial for job creation. The 
manufacturing industry, tourism operators, and all  businesses 
in our country are needed in order to generate wealth and 
create employment.  
 
11 
Notwithstanding the turmoil around us, we want to see our 
country proceed forward cautiously.  
Mr. Speaker 
This Budget is allocating 14.7 million euro for incentives to 
industry, an increase of five million euro on last year.  
This past year, 35 projects for factories and companies have 
been approved so far with an investment of 145 million euro. 
These projects are expected to create 700 jobs over three years. 
We must maintain this pace make Malta more and more 
attractive for local and foreign investment. 
We must also maintain support for our industry so that it can 
expand but can also be prepared for the challenges related to 
energy use. We are aware that the international price of oil is 
putting new burdens on the manufacturing industry which 
consumes large quantities of energy. We believe that we must 
protect competitiveness through investments focused on the 
management and the generation of clean energy.  
Therefore, we are investing three million euro over a three-year 
period in fiscal incentives to those industries which consume 
more than 2Gwh per year and which invest in energy-saving 
measures and in systems which produce energy from clean 
sources. 
We have started work on BioMalta Campus: an industrial park 
with a 30 million euro investment which will provide the 
necessary infrastructure for research and industrial innovation 
in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry.  
This project is also linked to the participation of the company 
Sultan Scientific which will launch the 200 million euro Global 
 
12 
Medi-Science Fund based in Malta. This Fund will invest in 
projects which will establish themselves in the BioMalta Campus 
or joint projects on an international level. 
This year we have also started an extensive programme of 
upgrading works in a number of industrial zones with an 
investment of 16 million euro; work at Ħal Far and Bulebel has 
reached an advanced stage.  
The Government appreciates that increases in the service 
charge are an increase to the industry’s cost base. Nevertheless, 
I reiterate what I have already declared to the House. The 
proposed service charge which, after consultation with the 
Chamber of Commerce, has been reduced to €3.50 per square 
metre, will not go to the Government or to the Malta Industrial 
Parks once tenants’ associations are set up in the respective 
zones. Until discussions with the Chamber of Commerce are 
concluded, contracts which expire will be renewed at the 
current rate. 
Each industrial zone will have its own management which will 
be answerable to the respective tenants’ association. If the 
amount collected is higher than what is needed for the 
maintenance of the zone, the surplus will be returned or an 
adjustment is made in that zone’s service charge.  
We are aware that certain high-added-value industrial sectors 
are finding difficulties in recruiting particular human resources 
in specialised fields from Malta, which could mean that our 
country could miss out on certain investments. Therefore, we 
are extending the fiscal incentives which we launched in the 
financial services and online gaming sectors to three other 
categories: 
 
13 
 to those Maltese with a presitigious career and who wish 
to return to our country to work in important industrial 
sectors; 
 to highly qualified and skilled foreign workers who are 
required for certain industrial sectors; and  
 to those persons who would like to carry out research or 
market an invention or technology in Malta. 
Mr. Speaker, we are doing all this in order to keep increasing 
the added value of Maltese industry and because we believe 
wholeheartedly in the future of the manufacturing industry 
based on research, innovation, and technological development. 
Innovation is the motor of economic growth  
Mr. Speaker 
The continuous process of innovation does not apply only to 
the manufacturing industry. The global economic and 
industrial situation is showing us clearly that there is no future 
for those who do not adapt and constantly strive to become 
more competitive. We believe in the need for a culture of 
innovation which is the principal instrument for economic 
growth even in traditional economic sectors. 
Therefore, as from next year we will embark on an awareness 
campaign for innovation and economic growth with an 
investment of a quarter of a million euro. We are also increasing 
the amount allocated for research to the Malta Council for 
Science and Technology to 1.6 million euro. In addition, we are 
creating a new Fund to assist the internalisation of research and 
innovation. We are also allocating funds to help our researchers 
participate in the European Union’s FP7 Programme.   
 
14 
We must also encourage many more children and youths to 
take an interest in science. Therefore we will be investing in an 
Interactive Science Center, a project which will cost 3.5 million 
euro. 
3.2 More investment in small and medium sized 
enterprises  
Mr. Speaker 
Small enterprises have been the ones which responded best to 
the need for job creation during the financial crisis.  
In the last three years we helped around 2,000 businesses a year 
through various Malta Enterprise schemes. We have helped 
them identify new markets, take on new projects, invest in their 
operations, increase their businesses and, above all, create more 
jobs. 
We pursued the MicroINVEST scheme. I am happy to report 
that through this scheme, which offers a reduction in tax of 40 
per cent of the investment value and 60 per cent in the case of 
Gozo, more than 700 enterprises benefitted. They invested 
almost 13 million euro and created around 200 new jobs.  
It is clear that Maltese businessmen are willing to invest. We 
acknowledge this and therefore we are extending this scheme 
for another year.  
I would also like to remind you of the ‚BOV JEREMIE 
Financing Package for SMEs including Micro-enterprises‛, 
which by means of a 52 million euro Fund, is providing loans to 
Maltese and Gozitan enterprises. Since March, around 110 
businesses have benefitted. Together they have invested around 
15 million euro.  
 
15 
A scheme for guarantees on loans to small enterprises: 
MicroGuarantee Scheme 
Mr. Speaker 
From discussions we held it emerged that there are business 
people who are proposing good commercial ideas but who 
have neither collateral for loans nor the 25 per cent minimum 
established under the previous scheme.  
Therefore we will launch another guarantee scheme on bank 
loans intended to incentivize business and the creation of jobs 
in small businesses. Through this scheme, the Government will 
provide bank guarantees on loans to existing or new and viable 
enterprises which need capital to invest and work. This scheme 
will: 
 be run together with commercial banks and according to 
commercial criteria; 
 be applicable to enterprises which employ up to 20 
persons; 
 be applicable for loans for capital investment or working 
capital; 
 guarantee loans of between 2,500 and 100,000 euro from 
commercial banks; 
 guarantee 90 per cent of the loan, while the rest must be 
guaranteed by the borrower; and will 
 guarantee loans which will mature in three months to 10 
years. 
 
16 
Persons qualifying for these loans will be asked to pay a 
premium on the interest rate on the amount borrowed or the 
balance. 
By means of this scheme, the Government will assume the risks 
itself so as to ensure that whoever is capable of creating a good 
project which can work can do so successfully. We are placing 
20 million euro in guarantees which can increase according to 
the experience and the evaluation we acquire in carrying out 
this scheme. If entrepreneurs and the banks make a success of 
this scheme, the Government will not fail to increase the 
amount of guarantees.  
Another call for 8 million euro from European Union Funds  
Mr. Speaker  
I would like to remind you that 38 million euro were given to 
more than 600 companies during the past two years under the 
20millionforindustry schemes over two years. This was an 
opportunity for Maltese enterprise to renew its operations, 
carry out research and innovation, e-business, and to look for 
new markets. Next February we will issue another call for the 
financing of projects with a value of 8 million euro. 
We are allocating 550,000 euro to improve industrial zones not 
under the Government’s direct responsibility.  
As promised, we published the Small Business Act to continue 
making our entrepreneurs’ life easier and reduce bureaucracy. 
We also introduced an SME impact assesment test which each 
law impacting on small businesses must undergo.  
As we announced, we have also set up a Consultative Body and 
a College of Regulators with the aim of advising the 
 
17 
Government on the formulation and the implementation of 
enterprise policy and regarding the regulatory policy for the 
sector.  
3.3 We continue to foster the financial service sector  
The financial service sector keeps growing at a fast rate. In the 
past three years, jobs in this sector increased by 1,000 and 
between 700 and 800 companies were registered every quarter 
in the past six years. In 2010, the financial intermediation sector 
contributed 7.5 per cent of the Gross Added Value of the 
Maltese economy, an increase of more than 30 per cent over the 
previous year. Today our country has 25 credit institutions, 14 
financial institutions, 52 insurance companies, 706 Funds 
including sub-funds, 112 investment services companies and 
122 trustees. 
We must keep working together, whether as operators or 
regulators so that, while ensuring that whoever operates in our 
country protects its reputation, we continue to attract new 
services that are having an important impact on our country’s 
economy. Finance Malta, a public private partnership between 
the Government and the operators, is carrying out an important 
task in the promotion of our country in this sector on an 
international level. To this end, the Government is increasing 
the allocation to 500,000 euro.  
3.4 Working to attract more tourism to our country  
Mr. Speaker 
This year we faced two big challenges in tourism: the economic 
situation in countries where our tourists travel from, and the 
crisis in North Africa, particularly in Libya. 
 
18 
We worked relentlessly, and the results speak for themselves. 
During the first nine months of this year, 1.1 million tourists 
visited our country, 70,000 more than the number in the same 
period in 2010, which was a record year. These visitors spent 
9.4 million nights in Malta, 336,503 more nights than the 
previous year. The expenditure by these tourists was  997.8 
million euro, an increase of 81.7 million euro over the same 
period in 2010. The number of passengers who arrived in Malta 
on board cruise liners increased to 67,982, 16,828 more than the 
first nine months of 2010. 
Mr. Speaker 
The work of the Malta Tourism Authority, together with the 
operators in this sector, is crucial to attract more tourists to our 
country. This year, we are once more increasing the Authority’s 
allocation by a million euro, to reach a total of 36 million euro. 
To achieve these results, we needed to continue investing in 
new air routes, in additional marketing and advertising mostly 
in principal markets and areas where we opened new routes, 
and in upgrading the Maltese touristic product. We will 
continue doing so next year and we are allocating three million 
euro for marketing and four and a half million euro for the 
opening of new routes. 
We are making an effort to spread tourism evenly throughout 
the year. We have managed to get to the stage where we now 
have more than 100,000 tourists a month for seven months of 
the year. 
The upgrading of our touristic product plays an important role 
in this Government’s strategy. This investment attracts more 
tourists 
to 
our 
country 
and 
improves 
our 
country’s 
environment. Besides the continuous investment in the general 
 
19 
infrastructure of the country and other projects such as the one 
in the entrance to Valletta and other embellishment projects 
throughout the whole country, we have also completed the 
work on the St Paul’s Bay promenade and those at Fond Għadir 
and Qawra. We have also continued the management of six 
bays around Malta. 
We are allocating 4.2 million euro to pursue work other projects 
throughout next year. These include Aquarium in Qawra and 
Pembroke Gardens, where work has now started.  
We are also investing another 4.2 million euro in archaeological 
sites around Malta and Gozo to continue increasing the value of 
the tourist’s experience in our country. 
We have continued working in the interest of our country’s 
tourism operators. We are providing the necessary assistance 
for the improvement of touristic projects by private operators 
and for their marketing and competitiveness. This scheme has 
an allocation of 10 million euro and so far there have been three 
calls with the first set of projects approved under the first call 
closing this year. 
Throughout 2012, Local Councils and various associations will 
benefit from 3.3 million euro in European Union and Maltese 
Government Funds during 2012 to carry out a number of 
projects concerning the physical appearance and history of our 
country’s localities. They include Ta’ Pinu and the Victoria 
Foundation in Gozo, historic centres in various villages, and 
public gardens. 
 
 
 
20 
Other schemes which will continue to be implemented after the 
success of the previous years include: 
 assistance to the public and parastatal sector to attract 
conferences to Malta;  
 a human resources training programme; and 
 granting of soft loans for tourist operators. 
The tourist product is also the service we offer those who visit 
us. That is why we have invested in a number of initiatives, 
such as ongoing training to the employees, and in an 
educational campaign about tourism aimed at children. 
Mr. Speaker 
The tourism industry knows that next year it will face various 
challenges connected to the economic uncertainty in the 
principal markets. Notwithstanding this, we will ensure that we 
have the necessary resources to remain competitive in this 
service which is most important for our country’s economy . 
Airmalta 
Mr. Speaker, in this Budget we are committing 20 million euro 
to the restructuring of Airmalta, which will increase in the 
following years according to the restructuring plan. The 
Government remains committed to seeing our country’s 
national airline carrying on with its important function. 
However, everyone must understand that discussions cannot 
be extended indefinitely. This can lead to an irreversible 
situation, with serious consequences for the families which 
depend on this enterprise and for our country.  
 
21 
The European Commission is expecting the Government’s final 
plan but this cannot be presented if there is no agreement on 
the fundamental changes in work practices which have to be 
made. Without these changes, the plan will fail. The 
Government believes that the final packet offered by the 
company management concerning retirement schemes as well 
as the changes requested and the compensation offered are 
reasonable. Refusing them can only lead to the outsourcing of 
certain operations or to the reduction of employees according to 
our country’s laws.  
Further investment in cultural programmes 
Mr. Speaker 
Cultural development is at the core of the Government’s vision 
for the future of our country. We have a clear and ambitious 
vision: that of making cultural and creative activities the most 
dynamic aspect of social and economic life. We will therefore 
keep strengthening the government framework in relation to 
culture while supporting independent operators, businesses 
and cultural and creative organisations.  
Public cultural entities are crucial to cultural activity in our 
country. These impart value to other sectors, like the education, 
business, creativity and tourism sectors. We will be investing 
over 7.7 million euro in these entities for the coming year, an 
increase of nearly half a million euro.  
The management of cultural resources in all their different 
forms requires the services of professionals and experts who are 
capable of preserving, interpreting and presenting the treasures 
and the various collections which bear our identity as a nation. 
Without these, we are not able to build a society which can 
 
22 
recognise the value of its own culture in a world which is 
continuously becoming more globalised. We are paying 
particular attention to contemporary cultural experience, 
including in the presentation of Maltese heritage.  
We will be allocating nearly half a million euro to a number of 
festivals and to new art-related activities, like the Children’s 
Arts Festival, a Baroque Music Festival and an arts program 
related to the open-air theatre in Valletta. We will also be 
increasing allocations to the National Orchestra, to the Manoel 
Theatre, to the St James Cavalier Centre for Creativity and to 
the Malta Council for Culture and the Arts.  
During the coming year we will allocate 200,000 euro in order 
to initiate the process of moving the National Museum of Fine 
Arts from its current location to the Auberge d’Italie in 
Merchants Street. This is an important step which shows this 
Government’s determination towards putting artistic and 
creative expression in the very centre of our country’s cultural 
regeneration.   
Mr. Speaker 
This will result in an increase of over one million euro, 
equivalent to 12 percent of Government expenditure on its 
cultural 
entities 
and 
programmes. 
This 
also 
includes 
preparations for Malta’s hosting of the European Capital of 
Culture in 2018. We acknowledge that this event is more than a 
series of cultural activities. It is an extensive process during 
which we will strengthen our structures, increase cultural 
participation and appreciation, and promote Malta as a centre 
of culture and creativity. Above all, this is a process which will 
create new employment opportunities in the cultural sector, 
and a stronger demand for a high-level cultural experience.  
 
23 
The Creative Economy 
During the coming year, Malta will be hosting the European 
Film Academy Awards, which is an important event. This event 
is held in Berlin every two years, and in other countries during 
the other years. In 2010, Malta won the right to hold this event 
here. This event will help Malta further consolidate its 
reputation in this industry. The ceremony will be transmitted 
live in over 50 countries around Europe, and will therefore 
serve a good advertisement for our country.  
We will continue our promotional efforts in the film industry in 
order to attract more productions to Malta through which the 
economy 
will 
benefit 
directly 
and 
which 
will 
create 
employment opportunities. We are also working to keep 
improving the skills in the Maltese film industry through 
courses for which we are bringing foreign professionals to 
Malta. 
Additionally, 
funds 
will 
be 
used 
for 
further 
development of the Maltese film industry, to which we are 
allocating 250,000 euro. 
Mr. Speaker 
We believe that our competitiveness in these sectors, both on a 
national as well as on an international level, will increase 
through benefits related to copyright.  
In the 2010 budget, we had announced an initiative related to 
royalties linked to patents. In this budget, we are extending this 
initiative to cover works protected by copyright, including 
books, film scripts, music and art. This benefit will consist of a 
tax exemption on income from copyright. This scheme should 
contribute towards attracting international artists to Malta, to 
 
24 
make Malta more attractive to the film industry and to create 
broader economic benefits in various sectors.  
Mr. Speaker 
The Government believes that culture and creativity too can 
contribute towards the creation of more jobs. Having increased 
the allocation to the cultural and creative sectors by 11 percent 
in the previous budget, we are now seeing positive results in 
direct investments. We provided direct assistance to 80 creative 
businesses through the INVEX programme, the Malta Film 
Fund, and the audiovisual sector training programme.  
We also invested in over 100 arts projects through the Malta 
Arts Fund and the President’s Award for Creativity, while 18 
projects were developed by schools and professionals through 
the Kreattiv programme.  
We will continue this investment during the coming years. We 
believe that our country has the potential to keep strengthening 
these cultural and creative sectors. Creativity helps the 
economy 
operate, 
creates 
specialised 
employment 
opportunities, 
enlarges 
cultural 
knowledge, 
strengthens 
diversification in the tourism sector and strengthens our 
presence on the international scene. We will therefore continue 
to address the development of these sectors in a strategic way 
through new fiscal measures. 
After having provided the ‘culture card’ to around 15,000 
students, we will now provide an added incentive to cultural 
education by extending the income tax reduction on sports 
education to cultural education as well. Parents whose children 
attend courses in cultural and creative teaching institutions will 
benefit from a €100 reduction on taxable income for costs 
 
25 
related to courses given by licensed or accredited schools or 
teachers.  
In order to provide this sector with an incentive to better 
organise itself, we will provide an exemption from the payment 
of registration fees for new companies in this sector as well as 
on their annual payments to the MFSA for three years with the 
aim of further helping this sector obtain a professional status 
and regular activities. 
We are also allocating 40,000 euro for a Public Lending Rights 
Fund in order for authors and translators of books in Maltese 
receive appropriate remuneration when their publications are 
borrowed from public libraries. 
Mr. Speaker 
After investing in research and strategy for the development of 
digital games, we will continue to invest in this sector as part of 
three new measures. We know that the expansion of this sector 
depends on the development of Maltese talent. For this reason:  
 we will establish the Malta Games Fund with an 
investment of 150,000 euro so that, as we have already 
done with other fund programmes, we can invest in the 
development of the local industry through projects 
related to digital games;  
 we will also be offering a tax credit scheme to Maltese 
companies wishing to commission educational or 
promotional digital games which credit will be granted 
on the expenditure incurred on the development of the 
game or on a maximum expenditure of 15,000 euro; and 
 
26 
 to attract more experts in these specialised sectors to our 
shores, we are extending the flat 15 percent income tax 
scheme for international professionals such as game 
directors and game designers. We will also extend this 
scheme to academics and researchers in the research and 
development sectors. 
Mr. Speaker  
The strategy for cultural and creative industries stresses the 
importance of creative clusters which are conducive to urban 
regeneration and increased economic activity in these sectors. 
All this while offering a package of improved products and 
services which is also capable of reaching foreign markets.  
The first of such projects will consist in the identification of 
Valletta as a cultural and creative city. While acknowledging 
that the regeneration of Valletta requires substantial investment 
related to restoration works, we also acknowledge that the city 
also becomes more alive, attractive and artistically vibrant 
thanks to the people who live and work in it. We will therefore 
offer an innovative scheme to self-employed persons registered 
as authors, composers, visual artists and performing artists, 
film artists and design artists working in the City of Valletta. 
We will also extend the CREATE scheme to the whole area of 
Valletta so as to encourage more creative activity in our capital 
city. 
We will also launch a pilot project in Valletta to continue 
strengthening Malta’s potential as an area for creative exchange 
in the Mediterranean and as a country that is attractive to 
foreign markets. By mean of this project Government property 
will be developed into creative clusters by artistic groups, 
 
27 
creative businesses and individuals wishing to invest in studios 
and workshops.   
These measures will continue to draw our country nearer to the 
aims set for competitiveness in the creativity sector, and include 
those set with the aim of having Malta host the European 
Capital of Culture in 2018. 
 
3.5 Protecting the consumer  
In our electoral program, we had promised to strengthen 
consumer protection. For this reason, this year we have 
established the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs 
Authority. The decisions and actions that the Authority is 
taking, ranging from school uniforms to a reduction in 
medicine prices, from the market supply of television services 
to the implementation of new standards in the consumer’s 
interest, all bear witness to the fact that we have established a 
truly strong regulator.   
We have launched the Trust You scheme where business 
owners bind themselves to give a good service to the consumer. 
We are further strengthening the information available to the 
consumer so as to enable him to make better choices.   
We promised to work towards a lowering of medicine prices by 
importers and manufacturers and in an process which started 
more than a year ago, through the commitment of all parties, 
we have achieved a price reduction in 176 different medicines. 
We will continue working to further lower medicine prices, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
28 
We promised to introduce a new law which permits class action 
lawsuits. This enables consumers to file a single lawsuit to 
demand both a legal remedy and the payment of damages. We 
have published a draft and, after the conclusion of a 
consultation process, we will shortly submit it before 
Parliament. This right will also be given to enterprises, 
constituted bodies and registered consumer associations.  
We will draw up a strategy report for consumer life-long 
education.    
The Medicines Authority will proceed with the information 
campaign ‘Your Medicines’ and with its work to inform 
consumers and health care professionals about the proper use 
of medicines.    
We will provide aid to consumers who file a suit before the 
Consumer Tribunal, are asked to pay for the arbiter-appointed 
expert, and end up dropping the action due to such expenses.  
3.6 Investing in the integration of workers in the 
labour market  
Mr. Speaker 
Creating jobs for our workers remains an absolute priority for 
this Government. Besides the economic value, work also has a 
huge social value. Persons who are distant from the formal 
economy are at greatest risk of poverty and social exclusion.  
It is for this reason that this Budget is dedicating the sum of 10.8 
million euro to the Employment and Training Corporation, 
including European Union Funds, to continue administering 
some 10 programs and schemes which provide training to more 
 
29 
individuals to enable them to enter the labour market earlier or 
to become more flexible.    
Between the year 2009 and September of this year, over 11,000 
people made use of the Employability Programme. We are 
estimating that by next year, around 32,500 persons will receive 
training under this Programme and we are therefore 
allocating two million euro.   
Over 125 people participated in the ETC Training Subsidy 
Scheme, and 194 people in the Academic Training Subsidy 
Scheme. The Work Trial Scheme has so far attracted 563 
persons.  
The results achieved under the Community Work Scheme are 
encouraging and, for this reason, we will continue to extend 
this scheme to the coming year. So far, 224 people who had 
been on the unemployment register for five years or more, and 
who receive social benefits, are working 30 hours a week, 
including maintenance works and public garden embellishment 
and sports facilities in our towns and villages.   
The Employment Aid Programme is one of the most successful 
programmes. As a result of this Programme, 2,157 people 
returned to the labour market between 2009 and October of this 
year.  
The same results are being achieved under the Training Aid 
Programme to which, for 2012, we are allocating 4.1 million 
euro. This Programme subsidises between 25 and 80 per cent of 
the training expenses. Over 3,100 applications have been made, 
out of which 2,191 have been accepted and a grant agreement 
with a total value of 5.7 million euro has been issued. Around 
20,174 persons will benefit from this Programme.  
 
30 
Mr. Speaker 
The Government will also launch a consultation process with 
social partners on the Active Labour Market Policy for the 
preparation of a long-term policy concerning the labour market. 
The principal aim is to incentivise more people, primarily 
women, to enter the labour market. The Active Labour Market 
Policy is a long-term plan to increase the human resources 
contribution in the labour market through which there will be 
an increase in the productivity of the Maltese economy.    
Initiatives to encourage more women to enter the labour 
market   
Mr. Speaker 
As I have mentioned previously, we will continue working so 
that more women enter the labour market.  
We are having positive results. We must aid in the creating of a 
proper work-family balance.   
In the last 10 years, female participation in the labour market 
increased from 32.2 to 40.5 per cent. This increase is beneficial 
to the women themselves, their families and society.   
We will continue to invest in fiscal incentives, as a result of 
which over 8,600 women returned to the labour market while 
saving around 10 million euro in income tax payments.   
We have opened 13 childcare centres in the last few years for 
children to follow programme based on the concept of educare 
from an early age, which is central to their development. In this 
Budget we are increasing our expenditure to 1.3 million euro to 
open three new centres. We will continue giving further 
 
31 
incentives and subsidies which help to render this service more 
affordable and accessible for everyone.   
Mr. Speaker 
We want to continue rewarding hard work and effort if we 
really want to increase labour market participation, in 
particular among women. We still believe that in uncertain 
economic circumstances, a tax reduction measure on income 
will help to incentivise work.  
The Government’s aim remains to lead our country to a 
situation which allows us to fulfil the last part of our electoral 
promise on income tax reduction. We believe that in the right 
circumstances, this should contribute towards economic 
development. But good governance and responsibility dictate 
that in the present uncertain economic climate, the introduction 
of this measure would be harmful rather than beneficial. By 
means of this measure, it is estimated that the income tax 
revenue in the first year would decrease by around 40 
million euro. The Government is convinced that as time goes 
by, this would be recovered by the economic growth that it will 
generate. But in the present situation, this cannot occur.   
We also want to create the required room for manoeuvre next 
year in case the Government needs to intervene to protect 
work, as it did in 2009. This was done while avoiding the 
negative financial situation that our neighbouring countries 
experienced.   
Mr Speaker 
As I have mentioned previously, we must encourage more 
women to enter the labour market. We must make the labour 
market much more attractive for parents.   
For this purpose, we will carry out an important reform in the 
income tax system. Besides the single and joint computations, 
 
32 
by which a married couple declares its income jointly, we are 
going to introduce a new category called the ‚parent 
computation‛.   
This computation will be eligible for parents supporting 
children who are not gainfully employed up to 18 years of age. 
If the children are still in tertiary education, this age limit is 
extended to 21 years.  
The rates for this computation will be those listed in table 3.1 
which I hereby request the House to consider as read.   
 
Table 3.1

This will mean that married couples with children will save 
between €150 and €840 in income tax yearly payments. More 
than 55,000 families will benefit through this measure which 
will result in a decrease of 10 million euro in government tax 
revenue. I request the House to consider as read table 3.2, 
which contains examples of income tax savings.

I would like to take the opportunity to remind you that, with 
the tax reductions that we have enacted in the past five years, 
we have saved our families 680 million euro. This is over and 
 
34 
above the measures that we have taken in favour of women 
who benefit from an untaxed year for every child, and the tax 
credits that we have given to the small businesses in our 
country.   
Maternity leave 
The Government believes that maternity leave should be 
increased from 14 weeks to 16 weeks as from next year and this 
should be increased by a further two weeks in 2013. The extra 
weeks will be payable from public finances with a fixed weekly 
rate of 160 euro. The Government considers that this measure 
should be introduced after a discussion in the MCESD. For this 
reason, the Government is requesting MCESD to conduct 
discussions and come up with conclusions, by the end of this 
year, on the best way to implement this in order to have the 
minimum negative impact possible on the private sector, 
especially on small businesses.   
Other measures 
We will also introduce amendments in the part-time tax rules in 
order to remove some anomalies which were having a negative 
impact, particularly on pensioners and some Government 
employees.   
At present, pensioners working part-time with the Government 
are not entitled to the 15 per cent rate available to those 
working part-time in the private sector. This distinction will 
come to an end, and all these pensioners will now be able to 
benefit from the favourable rate of 15% on part-time work.   
Furthermore, the definition of ‚same employer‛ in the case of 
public sector employees will be extended since it is currently 
limiting the benefit excessively. The Government will no longer 
 
35 
be considered as ‚same employer‛ if the entities involved are in 
fact separate. This will enable more workers to benefit from the 
15% tax rate on part-time work.   
We will also extend the deadline for the payment of the 15% tax 
on part-time work from the 15th February until the 30th June in 
order to give more time for the payment of tax arrears.   
Strengthening fiscal enforcement  
The amalgamation process of the tax departments will 
continue. This will lead to more coordination and the 
strengthening of tax enforcement in our country.   
We must make better use of information technology to further 
improve the service, including the online filing of VAT returns.   
Moreover, we are aware of the problems that exist in some 
businesses. While they may wish to settle their VAT arrears, 
they have some difficulty doing so as a result of the amount of 
fines that they have accumulated. The Government will launch 
a scheme having a limited time-window whereby those having 
VAT payments in arrears will be able to regularise their 
position.   
For this reason, anyone who had to file a VAT return by the 15th 
October 2011and failed to do so, or who has some arrears to 
pay, will be given until the 15th January to send the missing 
returns. The arrears due will be payable until the 15th January 
2013, with a reduction in the amount of fines and accumulated 
interest, according to the length of the period of time during 
which the payment will be made. The details of this scheme 
will be announced in a Legal Notice which is to be published.   
 
36 
This scheme will be applicable only to the arrears accumulated 
until today. One of the conditions will be that the returns due 
from tomorrow the 15th November onwards are to be sent in 
time and with payment in full.    
 
Customs and excise  
 
The customs duty on fuel for bunkering of ships outside 
territorials waters will increase to 5 euro per tonne. This will 
not affect in any way the price of fuel sold in Malta. Customs 
duty on cement will increase by 3 euro per tonne, while 
minimum excise duty on cigarettes will increase by 5.8 per cent 
on each packet of twenty cigarettes. Excise duty on other 
tobacco products will increase by 8.5 per cent. Regarding 
mobile telephony, excise duty will remain unchanged but the 
basic rate will change from tariff to volume.  
 
4. An investment programme in our country’s 
environment and infrastructure  
Investment in our country’s environment and infrastructure 
remains a major pillar of our country’s economic and social 
development and a creator of jobs. In this Budget we are 
investing heavily to improve our environment, roads, air 
quality, public spaces, our towns and cities, the sea and 
harbours and Gozo. 
We drafted the National Environmental Policy which, after a 
consultation period, is now being finalised. This Policy has six 
objectives: the development of the environmental economy, the 
use of resources in a more efficient and responsible manner, the 
protection of the environmental health, the embellishment of 
 
37 
urban, rural and coastal localities, the protection of Gozo and 
the eco-Gozo Vision, and the barriers to the challenges of 
climate change, environmental emergencies, and the reduction 
in biodiversity. A number of measures are being proposed 
some of which are already being implemented or been started, 
while others are planned to come into force in the coming year 
or further into the future. 
In order for this Environmental Policy to succeed, we have to 
set aside financial and human resources for its implementation. 
Therefore, we continued strengthening the Environmental 
Directorate at MEPA, and will continue to do so.  
During the years, we invested heavily in the infrastructure that 
our country needed to address the environmental problems. 
We want to continue investing further: 
 in our infrastructure, in our country’s heritage, in our 
roads and public spaces and in reducing air pollution 
caused by traffic;  
 in systems of electricity generation which are cleaner and 
incentivise the use of alternative energy; and 
 in our towns and cities in order to improve their 
appearance and the quality of life of the people who live 
in them. 
We need to move towards a system of consumption and 
production with greater environmental awareness. The 
Government needs to set an example, even so because it is the 
major consumer in our country’s economy.  
We are also close to launching our strategy for boosting the 
Green Economy. This is our initiative for which we worked 
 
38 
closely with many parties, including several constituted bodies, 
who all contributed so that we may create another sector in our 
economy which should also create more jobs and wealth. In the 
coming months we will be working with the ETC as well as 
with our education institutions in order to create training 
programmes for workers who want to work in these new 
sectors of our economy.   
4.1 Investment in infrastructure, heritage, and the 
reduction of air pollution  
Better roads increase the traffic efficiency and reduce 
congestion and air pollution. During this year, we boosted 
works on arterial residential roads. The major part of these 
works is expected to be ready during the coming year. 
We will continue with works on 140 new residential roads and 
will invest more than 50 million euro on our arterial roads. 
These include Xatt l-Għassara tal-Għeneb in Marsa, Triq il-
Kunsill tal-Ewropa and Triq Garibaldi in Ħal Luqa, Triq il-
Marfa in Mellieħa, and the road which leads from Xewkija to 
Rabat in Gozo. We started work on the underpass of Triq 
Diċembru Tlettax and the Ta’ Pennellu Bypass in Mellieħa.  
The Local Councils are also contributing towards improving 
roads in our country. We have drawn up a scheme of public 
private partnership for residential roads, and in the last two 
years, we invested more than 15 million euro for this purpose. 
The project is ambitious but the results are visible. We have 
completed more than 230 roads in Swieqi, Għargħur, 
Birkirkara, Nadur, St Paul’s Bay, Ħad Dingli, Xagħra, Mqabba, 
Kerċem, Ħal Lija, Għajnsielem, Gżira and Naxxar. In the 
coming months we will continue to build more of these roads, 
and thus we are increasing this budget to 1.4 million euro. 
 
39 
Public transport reform 
In spite of the difficulties in implementing this reform, the 
Government believes that when the reform meets the ambitious 
targets we have put in front of us, it will give a positive and 
important contribution towards the environment, the quality of 
life, and the economic efficiency of the country, while reducing 
the dependence on public spending.  
Today we have a fleet of Euro V vehicles. Emissions have been 
reduced drastically and vehicles are accessible to all persons 
with disabilities, old people, and parents with pushchairs.  
We know that much more is needed to have the public 
transport service that the Maltese deserve. However we are 
determined to achieve that. 
Further incentives for cleaner private vehicles on our roads 
The Government’s policy is to promote cleaner cars on our 
roads with less emissions in the air we breathe. The European 
Union certified that we have a registration tax system that 
meets the environmental objectives. 
The average age of private cars on our roads is of about 12 
years, which is high when compared with the European Union 
average. Last year we introduced the concept of a Euro 
standard in the registration tax for commercial vehicles. It is 
now time to also introduce this principle to private cars where 
registration tax will start to be calculated on the Euro standard, 
carbon dioxide, particulate matter, length and value of the car 
according to the make.  
Around 19 per cent of the cars registered during this year were 
of the type Euro 1 to 3 or older. This was taking place when, 
 
40 
during the same period, we had a scheme to remove old 
vehicles from our roads and to change to vehicles with lower 
emissions. Thus, with effect from 1st January, the registration 
tax on emissions for vehicles Euro 1 to 3 and older, which 
pollute more, will increase. Cars with emissions Euro 4 and 
Euro 5 will continue to pay the same rates currently in force. 
In order to continue meeting the environmental targets in this 
sector for the second consecutive year, we will be giving an 
incentive to those who buy a new car which causes less harm 
the environment while at the same time scrapping the old car. 
The incentive will amount to 15.25 per cent of the car value 
according to the make issued from the manufacturer or from 
the authorised agent of the manufacturer up to a maximum of 
2,000 euro. The car needs to be new and with a Euro 5 engine or 
better with a low level of emissions up to 150g/km and the 
length must not exceed 4,460mm.  
The scheme will enter into force as from 1st December 2011 and 
will remain in force for one year or until 3,000 persons have 
benefited from it. 
Vehicle licences 
There are a number of persons who have pending licence fees 
or administrative fees related to cars. We will be introducing a 
scheme whereby persons who have vehicle licences or 
administrative payments in arrears, can regularise their 
position.  
Those who disposed of their vehicle and did not inform 
Transport Malta will be able to regularise their position by 
paying a penalty of €125. One can decide to scrap the vehicle 
and pay the same penalty. Whoever garaged the vehicle and 
did not return the plates to the Transport Authority will be able 
 
41 
to regularise his position by paying a penalty of €125 and half 
the licence payments due. Whoever has a vehicle but has 
pending payments and wishes to continue using the vehicle on 
the road will be able to do so by regularising his position, 
paying the licences due and paying a penalty of €125. 
The scheme will be open for one year as from 1 January 2012. 
4.2 We will continue to invest in cleaner systems of 
electricity generation and incentivise the use of 
alternative energy 
Mr. Speaker 
The energy sector is at the heart of society, the environment and 
our economy.  
We have heard comments against our investment in the 
electricity generation and distribution system. But one should 
remember that when the power station extension in Delimara 
starts functioning next year, everyone will start to enjoy its 
benefits. This is because besides the improvement in the air 
quality, the new project will mean a reduction of approximately 
30 per cent of fuel consumption.  
As shown in the Estimates of Enemalta Corporation, which will 
be presented to this House in the coming days, the Corporation 
is buying oil for 2012 at more than 99 dollars per barrel, when 
current tariffs are calculated using a price of 81 dollars per 
barrel.  However, the Corporation does not need to ask for a 
revision of the tariffs because of the positive impact that the 
power station extension of Delimara will have on reduced fuel 
consumption to produce the same level of electricity. 
 
42 
Thus, in spite of the increase in the price of oil by about 30 per 
cent in the last two years, we will be able to keep the tariffs on 
the same level of today. This means that the amount of 20 
million euro that we will save, will be all passed on to the 
consumer.  
Mr. Speaker,  
Recently the Opposition took a position where it stated that if it 
is elected to Government it will move from direct taxation 
systems to taxes on those sectors that pollute the environment. 
We are pleased that after a number of years the Opposition is in 
agreement with the Government. I would like to remind you 
that in the fiscal reform that we had published in the Pre 
Budget Document of 2007, we had said:  
‚In the medium term, the Government believes that, the 
process of transferring the burden of taxation from income onto 
consumption and the environment, based on the polluter pays 
principle, should be the strategic centre of every future 
change<‛ 
In light of this fact, from the 2008 budget we consistently 
reduced the burden of taxation on income, while the electricity 
and water tariffs started to reflect the international price of oil, 
and the investment in the generation and distribution systems. 
Here I have to remind you that this means that every year the 
Government is collecting 152 million euro less every year, much 
more than that collected by Enemalta from the revised bills. 
Besides the reduction in tax, the Government gave a number of 
incentives so that the families can invest in solar water heaters, 
photovoltaic panels, schemes that enable people to waste less 
energy, like the appliances scheme, the light bulbs, and others.   
 
43 
May I remind you that besides the investment of 183 million 
euro in the power station extension, we are also investing in an 
interconnector that will connect Malta to the European energy 
grid with an investment of 150 million euro. This is important 
for us to satisfy the ever increasing demand for energy, and will 
be an important step for us to meet our ambitious targets in the 
environmental sector, while reducing our dependence on the 
price of oil, which is very volatile. 
Moreover, we are considering an investment plan for a pipeline 
infrastructure that brings to Malta natural gas from the 
European network. This infrastructure requires a substantial 
amount of financial resources. The Government already 
presented a case to the European Commission in order for 
Malta to be allocated funds and the Commission, in its proposal 
for the Financial Framework 2014-2020, is proposing that Malta 
receives funds to accomplish this project.  
With the advantages of this project, the price of gas will also 
decrease for the Maltese consumer. One should mention that 
today the price of LPG gas, which is used in Malta, is 11c per 
kilowatt hour. In other countries of the European Union that 
have a distribution infrastructure of natural gas to households, 
the price paid for gas is much lower. In Italy, for example, the 
price is 7c per kilowatt hour, 36 per cent less than that paid by 
Maltese users, while in Ireland, the price is 5c per kilowatt 
hour, 55 per cent less.   
To continue assisting our families in meeting the challenges 
of the energy sector 
These last few years we gave various incentives to families so 
that they may invest and meet challenges in the energy sector. 
This year we introduced another scheme to help families invest 
 
44 
in systems of photovoltaic panels. The interest shown was 
considerable and 3,559 applications were received. These are 
being processed and grant offer letters will be issued so that the 
applicants who meet the criteria may buy, install and pay for 
the system. Together with the families which applied for the 
scheme, we invested more than 30 million euro for this scheme. 
Similarly, during this year, we launched an aid scheme for 
Maltese and Gozitan households who invest in solar water 
heaters. This scheme is being managed together with another 
scheme for the purchase of solar water heaters by families 
which meet a number of social criteria. Up to the end of 
October, 1,014 applications were processed for the grant of 
€400. This meant a total investment of 1.6 million euro. In the 
scheme for families with social criteria, 15 applications are 
being processed and this will lead to these families investing 
more than 8,000 euro. 
Together with the schemes launched in 2009 and 2010, 1,771 
families benefited from a grant to buy photovoltaic panels. This 
means an investment of 18 million euro. In another scheme, 
3,466 families benefited from a grant to buy a solar water heater 
with a total investment of more than 6.5 million euro. 
Next year, in addition to these schemes which are being 
extended, we will introduce another scheme for anyone who 
wishes to invest in the roof insulation and double glazing. We 
will be granting 15.25 per cent, up to a maximum of 1,000 euro, 
to whoever undertakes this investment. We are budgeting the 
sum of 400,000 euro for this purpose. 
 
 
 
45 
4.3 More investment in our towns and cities to 
improve their appearance and the quality of life of 
the people that live there 
The Local Councils are giving an important contribution 
towards the attainment of the Government’s policy for a better 
environment in our towns and cities. We believed in Local 
Councils from their inception. We want Local Councils to be in 
a position to give the best services to their residents by 
continuing to strengthen the identity of their localities, 
continuing to improve the infrastructure, restoring historical 
sites, ensuring clean localities, improving our tourist product, 
and taking care of public places.  
In the last three and a half years, the Government transferred 
around 120 million euro to the Local Councils so that they can 
serve their functions, provide the best service to the residents, 
and 
implement 
a 
number 
of 
projects: 
installation 
of 
photovoltaic panels, upkeep of playing fields and public places, 
cultural activities, and the restoration of historical buildings 
and monuments. 
We will continue to increase the financial and human resources 
so that the Local Councils can continue to improve the service 
that they are already giving to the residents in their localities. 
We will increase the allocation from 29 million to 32 million 
euro. We are also allocating 1million euro for special initiatives 
in the localities. 
One has to applaud those Local Councils that are using the 
opportunity provided by European Union Funds in order to 
continue improving the quality of life of their residents. 
 
46 
During this year we continued to give back space to the public 
for the recreation of families. We opened a park in Xrobb l-
Għaġin and completely transformed the promenade and square 
in Marsaxlokk. We inaugurated Bisazza Street in Tas-Sliema as 
a pedestrian zone.  
Next year we will continue to invest to give more open spaces 
to the public by inaugurating a new garden in Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq, 
starting work on a new Civic Centre in Swieqi, continuing with 
the project of the Golden Mile in St Julians and carrying out 
several projects on historical centres, among others. 
We are also investing in the south of Malta. We continued with 
the work on the project ‚Stronger Cottonera Communities‛ which 
incorporates the embellishment of Dock Number One in 
Bormla. This project will cost 9.6 million euro, and so far we 
have completed Ġnien ta’ San Gwann t’Għuxa, the restoration 
of the tal-Verdala and ta’ San Nikola buildings. We also 
introduced a new system of public transport that connects 
together the Three Cities, and its environs.  
We submitted an application for European funds for the 
restoration and the use of Fort St Elmo, a project of 15 million 
euro. The development briefs of the projects in the historical 
buildings around Dock Number One, the Fisheries, and that 
which until today is known as Sir Paul Boffa Hospital are being 
prepared. 
Work is ongoing in the temples of Ġgantija in Gozo, nature 
trails in the park of Ħaġar Qim and Imnajdra, restoration and 
rehabilitation of the Inquisitor’s Palace in Birgu and in the 
Domus Romana, works on Torri ta’ l-Arloġġ and in the 
Maritime Museum, and conservation work on Verdala Palace 
and San Anton Palace.  
 
47 
During the coming year, we will continue to work on a number 
of projects, including in Fort St Angelo, the Hypogeum in Ħal 
Saflieni, Ġgantija Temples,  Ħal Tarxien Temples and the 
Catacombs of St Paul, the Roman Baths in Għajn Tuffieħa and 
the Ta’ Bistra Catacombs in Mosta, and in the Catacombs of St 
Augustine in Rabat. Concurrently, work will continue on the 
restoration of the fortifications of Valletta, Mdina, Birgu and the 
Citadel in Gozo, with an investment of 36 million euro. 
Valletta  
The work on the City Gate project, the new Parliament, the Old 
Theatre site, and the new square near St Catherine’s Church, is 
proceeding well. This project also includes a large garden in the 
ditch below City Gate. The investment for these projects will 
amount to almost 80 million euro. Such projects create jobs, 
leaving Maltese workers with more expendable income and 
contribute towards the economy while making our country 
more modern and attractive to tourists.  
We are keeping our promise of giving Valletta the dignity it 
deserves.   
The project of paving the streets in the centre of Valletta 
continued with an investment of two million euro. 
While we will continue with the project of restoration of the 
bastions, as I remarked earlier, we will also complete the work 
on Biagio Steps in Valletta which will serve as an interactive 
centre for the fortifications of Malta.  
Moreover, we are budgeting 400,000 euro for an intensive 
restoration of the interior of the Grandmaster’s Palace. 
 
48 
In the budget for next year we are also allocating 250,000 euro 
to continue the work on the preparation for Malta’s hosting of 
the European Cultural Capital 2018. 
A scheme that encourages the restoration and renovation of 
scheduled properties and those in urban centres 
Empty and derelict buildings in the town and city centres of 
Malta and Gozo are on the increase. The reasons include 
inheritance lawsuits, high restoration and conservation costs 
and restrictions on use. 
The Government believes in the value of the investment in the 
urban 
environment. 
This 
investment 
creates 
a 
better 
environment and jobs in the localities, while it directs the 
energy of the construction sector towards urban zones that 
require regeneration.  
Thus, we will introduce a number of incentives related to 
restoration and conservation works of scheduled buildings in 
grades 1 and 2, as well as properties in UCAs: 
1. Exemption from Duty on Documents on transfership 
between heirs in order to facilitate the consolidation of 
the property ownership, with this concession closing on 
31st December 2013; 
2. A scheme for private individuals who wish to restore 
their property where a rebate of 20 per cent will be given 
on the costs of restoration up to a maximum of 5,000 
euro; 
3. For individuals or companies who invest in the 
restoration of these properties to sell or rent a concession 
will be given as follows:  
 
49 
 Final witholding tax of 10 per cent on income from 
rent for residential purposes, and 15 per cent on 
income from rent for commercial purposes; and 
 Final witholding tax of 10 per cent in the case of a 
sale or the payment of 30 per cent tax instead of 35 
per cent on the gain; and 
4. A tax credit of 20 per cent on the expenditure that 
qualifies for restoration of property for the commercial 
purposes of the company and this will increase to 30 per 
cent in the case of grade 1 and 2 scheduled properties. 
The MEPA will be widening the permitted use for these types 
of properties so that their use as guest houses, offices, and other 
commercial premises will be permitted, while remaining 
compatible and complementary to the residential zones.  
One has to clarify that the benefit applies when the property is 
being restored and renovated, and not if the property is 
demolished to be rebuilt.    
4.4 Investment in the maritime infrastructure 
This year we also continued to strengthen our maritime 
infrastructure. Intensive work has been carried out on Lascaris 
Wharf to enable its use by some of the largest cruise liners in 
the world. The repair work on the breakwater of Marsaxlokk is 
proceeding well, while preparatory work has started on the 
Deep Water Quay in Grand Harbour. This equates to a total 
investment of 27.3 million euro. 
Intensive work is being carried out on the passenger terminal in 
Ċirkewwa, while the foundations for the internal roads around 
 
50 
the terminal are being prepared, with a total investment of 12 
million euro. 
Moreover, the Government is keeping its promise to rebuild the 
lift from Lascaris Wharf to the Upper Barrakka to facilitate the 
arrival to the City centre. This project, which will cost 2.5 
million euro, will be provide convenient access to the 
thousands of cruise liner passangers who visit Valletta. This 
will also encourage the resumption of boat trips between 
Valletta and Cottonera, not only for tourists. 
4.5 Waste management 
In the Solid Waste Management Strategy it was stipulated that 
we need to encourage waste separation in order to turn this 
waste into a resource. We all need to do all that is necessary so 
that the resource that can be recovered from waste is used for 
the national benefit. In order to achieve this goal, the 
Government invested all that was necessary to inform the 
public and to develop the necessary facilities. More investment 
will be dedicated so that we also continue to increase our 
participation in this waste management industry.  
During this year the collection of around 20,000 tonnes of 
recyclable separated waste is expected. 
The products that result from this waste will be out for sale 
every month. The best offers are selected and the waste is sold 
to be exported for recycling. This can happen because the 
Government has worked in a responsible manner during these 
last years so that. The environmental complex in Sant’Antnin in 
Wied il-Għajn was inaugurated one year ago today. Today we 
have a plant of the highest standard that turns waste into a 
resource. 
 
51 
Now that the schemes for the collection of packaging are 
progressing, the need is being felt for improving the 
coordination between the regulatory authorities, the schemes 
and the business representatives that market this type of waste 
on our market. For this purpose and, in order to continue 
strengthening the enforcement of the packaging regulations in 
our country, we will set up a Producer Responsibility 
Monitoring and Enforcement Committee with representatives 
from all interested parties in this field, including those of the 
authorised schemes, in order to continue strengthening that 
which we have achieved so far. 
 
 
5. Gozo 
Mr. Speaker 
Gozo still needs special consideration if we wish to ensure that 
the Gozitan families enjoy the full success of our country as 
well.  
Employment in Gozo is also a main priority. This year, we 
launched a number of initiatives in favour of the Gozitan 
operators and families, including: 
 200 Gozitan enterprises which benefited from the 
Microinvest scheme; 
 more than 150 enterprises which together employ more 
than 450 Gozitan workers, which benefited from the 
Employment Aid Programme; 
 411 
Gozitan 
families 
which 
participated 
in 
the 
installation scheme of photovoltaic systems, and 209 
 
52 
families which benefited from the solar water heaters 
scheme; and 
5.1 Projects  
During 2011, we continued working on a number of projects, 
some of which were concluded, while others are nearly 
concluded. These include: 
 the re-building of the roads of Ta’ Pinu and Xlendi, and 
works on the Dwejra road, with an investment of 1.1 
million euro; 
 work on the slaughterhouse; 
 an investment of 1.5 million euro in new equipment in 
the Radiology Department at the General Hospital in 
Gozo, leading to more than 800 CT Scans. Gozitan 
women also took part in the Breast Screening 
Programme in Gozo;  
 an investment of 1.5 million euros in the upgrading of 
the IT system at the General Hospital in Gozo, which 
enabled its connection to Mater Dei Hospital;  
 embellishment works in Villa Rundle, which are nearly 
concluded; 
 the conclusion in the Cittadella masterplan as a basis for 
a number of restoration and rehabilitation projects; 
 the closure of the last drainage outflow in Wied il-
Mielaħ; 
 the reform in the Public Transport and the restructuring 
works in the terminus in Rabat; and 
 
53 
 the drawing up of a strategy catering for the 
development of the human resources skills and the 
manner by which the Gozitan economy can be further 
upgraded. 
5.2 Permanent link between Gozo and Malta 
During this year, the Government initiated the first studies 
regarding the possibility of a tunnel between Gozo and Malta. 
These studies should lead us to have a clear idea of the options 
which may be considered in order for Gozo to have a 
permanent link with Malta. This is a long and delicate process 
which may have a huge impact in the economic and social 
development of Gozo, and therefore must be made in a way to 
allow that the strategic option made provides the best long 
term benefit for Gozo. 
5.3 Tourism in Gozo 
In this year’s budget, for the first time, we have allocated half a 
million euro for advertising the island of Gozo as a distinct 
tourist destination. The promotion of Gozo overseas was 
carried out along two main lines: one addressing the Maltese 
public and the other addressing specific markets, amongst 
which the markets for cruise liners and diving in countries such 
as France, Germany and the United Kingdom.  
Since the tourist industry in Gozo depends on self-catering 
accommodation especially farmhouses, we deem that we must 
revise all the licensing systems of this industry in order to 
provide more incentives for quality and investment in this 
sector. For this purpose, the Government will launch a wide 
consultation with all the concerned operators in order to draw 
 
54 
up a programme which will lead to substantial improvement in 
this sector. 
5.4 Eco-Gozo 
Mr. Speaker 
We continued our work to implement a number of measures 
announced in the five-year plan for Eco-Gozo. More than half 
of these proposals were carried out or are in the process of 
being carried out. These include ecological reclamation, water 
and waste management, projects related to renewable energy, 
and other initiatives directed to the communities.  
I request the House to consider as read Table 5.1 which lays 
down a list consisting of 16 projects which were carried out 
during this year. 
 
Table 5.1 
List of the main projects which were carried out in 2011 
 
Energy audits, mostly of Government buildings, in order to evaluate 
the possibility of having systems providing solar energy installed on 
their roofs; 
 
A research project regarding the potential of wind as a source of 
alternative energy; 
 
A programme for the cleaning up of valleys and collection of 
rainwater, and the cleaning up of the Grazzja and Ramla Valleys, 
another part of Marsalforn Valley, and the Għasri Valley; 
 
The repair of reservoirs and building of new ones in the gardens of 
Villa Rundle and  Marsalforn; 
 
55 
 
Investing $800,000 from a foundation of a private international 
company in a project related to the conservation and better use of 
water; 
 
Planting of more than 2,300 trees and bushes in Mġarr Grove; 
 
Work in the Government nursery in Dawwara which grows most of 
the trees and bushes being planted by means of the afforestation 
project and other initiatives; 
 
Work on a new Garden in Marsalforn which is reaching its final 
stage; 
 
Work on 51 projects from NGOs, Local Councils, and Administrative 
Committees,  with an allocation of 1.9 million euro, including the 
building of rubble walls, maintenance and embellishment in rural 
areas, restoration of old buildings, building of reservoirs for 
rainwater, change of energy saving lamps, educational campaigns, 
and initiatives related to a better quality of life, a clean rural and 
maritime environment; 
 
Artistic works from 120 artists who submitted drafts some of which 
will be used to embellish areas and public places; 
 
Extension of the agreement with the Environment Landscapes 
Consortium in order to maintain more roundabouts and soft areas 
throughout Gozo, especially in the main arteries; 
 
Restructuring works so the facilities in the Government Farm change 
to a Research, Development and Innovation Centre in the 
Agricultural sector together with the University of Malta; 
 
Educational campaigns amongst the farmers concerning the best use 
of pesticides; 
 
Educational campaigns amongst children who attend the schools in 
Gozo in order to promote healthy lifestyles and good environmental 
practices; 
 
56 
 
Establishing the Mental Health Association Gozo, and an initiative 
which will establish a Regional Council for Youths; and 
 
Monitoring project of the coastal waters. 
 
For the coming year, we are allocating four million euro in 
order to continue implementing these projects, and to keep 
carrying out the Eco-Gozo Vision. This includes starting a vast 
programme of aid so that the economic operators in Gozo can 
invest in energy from alternative sources. This programme 
starts next year and terminates the followin year and should 
increase the contribution of Gozo to obligations which our 
country has in the production of energy from clean sources 
while aiding the Gozitan industry in expenses relating to 
energy. 
 Here, I must add since it appears that by the end of 2012 the 
allocation of 25 million euro for eco-Gozo will not be totally 
absorbed. The Government commits itself to allocate the 
balance to 2013, as it also does with European Union Funds. 
Mr. Speaker 
More Gozitan students are furthering their studies at the 
University of Malta, MCAST or ITS. This will lead to additional 
expenses for the families of these students who must find 
accommodation in Malta together with any other expenses they 
might have. For this reason, we had revised the additional 
allowance which the Government grants to Gozitan students in 
Malta.  
As of the coming year, we will increase this allowance again, 
and we will bring every Gozitan student studying in Malta to 
 
57 
the same level, irrespective of whether the studies are being 
carried out at University, MCAST or ITS. The total allocation in 
order to aid these students for the coming year amounts to 
more than 700,000 euro. 
Also during the coming year, we will carry on more structural 
work in the Ninu Cremona Complex, in order to finalise a 
language lab for the hosting of a number of examinations. We 
will also continue working to further improve the health 
services offered by the Gozo General Hospital. 
We will continue with the maintenance programme in the 
roads in several areas, while starting the extensions in the roads 
leading to Ta’ Pinu and Xlendi, which add on to the works 
carried out so far. For this purpose, we are allocating 1.5 million 
euro. 
We will also continue the cleaning of valleys and collecting 
rainwater, building of new reservoirs and the maintenance of 
old ones, building more rubble walls, and a number of other 
initiatives in the agricultural, cultural, economic and social area.  
5.5 Gozo’s greatest challenge   
Mr. Speaker 
The greatest challenge for Gozo remains employment. Despite 
all efforts made in recent years, the progress in employment 
and jobs in Malta during the recent years is not proceeding at 
the same pace in Gozo.  Some situations may be improved with 
coordinated effort, such as the requirement that MEPA and 
other authorities understand better the reality in Gozo. In order 
to coordinate a National effort for the economic and social 
development in Gozo, the Prime Minister entrusted the 
Secretariat for Strategic Policy within his Office to focus the 
 
58 
efforts of all the public entities for the creation of more 
employment and better employment in Gozo.  Undoubtedly the 
studies related to the possibility of a permanent link between 
Gozo and Malta must also reflect this reality.   
 
6 
Education  
6.1 Developing each person’s potential  
Mr. Speaker 
The Government’s policy in the education sector endeavours to 
ensure that each person in our country is given the opportunity 
to develop his/her full potential. This policy works so that our 
families have a choice in their children’s education, a choice 
which ensures that education reaches its aim in the 
development of the person and is not used as a tool by the State 
to impose its ideology. This policy recognises education and 
training as the best investment in our country’s economy and 
competitiveness. 
We have done a lot in this sector over the years. But we realise 
that we can never say that we have done enough. We are 
determined to continue working and investing strongly in 
education. 
Thus for 2012 the investment in the education sector will be of 
359 million. In spite of efforts to reduce deficit, the investment 
in our younger generations’ education through National Funds 
will increase by 23 million euro. 
 
 
 
59 
6.2 Compulsory education  
Mr. Speaker 
Our commitment to continue improving the quality of our 
children’s education is key to our country’s success.  
We sustained our commitment to build modern schools and 
facilities which complement the reforms we carried out in this 
sector. After building boys’ secondary schools in Ħal Kirkop, 
Ħandaq, Verdala and Victoria, and a primary school in 
Pembroke, we also completed the secondary school in Żokrija 
in Mosta. These schools also have sports facilities which are 
used by the schoolchildren and by sports associations in the 
community. 
During this year, we started building the girls’ secondary 
school in Ħandaq and the plan is for the first students to use it 
in the next scholastic year. In 2012, we will start building a new 
girls’ secondary school in Ħal Kirkop, and indoor sports 
facilities next to the secondary school in Santa Venera. This will 
be carried out with another investment of 9 million euro. 
At present, we are also carrying out embellishment and 
maintenance projects in other schools, in Wied il-Għajn, the 
girls’ secondary school in Mosta, and the boys’ in Naxxar. We 
want our children to have the best environment in their schools.  
The Foundation for Tomorrow’s Schools, since it was set up, 
has invested a total of 90 million euro in the construction of 
new schools and in the maintenance of other existing ones. This 
is a substantial investment in the best interests of our children. 
However, buildings alone are not enough. 
 
60 
Mr. Speaker 
We want an educational system which increasingly addresses 
students’ and society’s needs, one which creates the space and 
the methods for our students to gain confidence, realises their 
capabilities and works to develop them. Therefore we are 
carrying out the reform of colleges, in the transition from 
primary to secondary school, the review of MATSEC, the 
reform of special schools, and work on the new National 
Curriculum. This evolution is sustained by technological 
equipment which makes learning interesting, creative and 
interactive. Today in our schools we find interactive 
whiteboards and other specialised equipment which offers a 
new experience in learning and teaching. We are nearing 
teaching which is more focused on the person, which gives each 
pupil the opportunity to develop his or her ideas and opinions. 
And we are not only doing this in State schools. This year we 
have also increased the financing of Church schools to continue 
implementing the reform in education. This means that Church 
schools are being given additional support and means to ensure 
education of the highest quality for their pupils and students. 
For next year we are allocating 45.2 million for these schools.  
Mr. Speaker 
The Nationalist Government has always believed that Maltese 
families should be able to choose which schools to send their 
children to. We fought for this choice and we are determined 
that pluralism in obligatory education should be sustained 
through every possible means. We recognise that private 
schools are giving a strong and important contribution to the 
education sector. We will remain committed to continue 
helping these schools. 
 
61 
Therefore, in 2012 we will set up a one million euro Fund in 
order to strengthen the sustainability of private schools. This 
Fund, which will be used by schools according to their pupil 
population, will apply for: 
 Services related to the individual needs of students; 
 investment in software and IT licences; 
 improvement in science facilities; 
 improvement in sports facilities; and  
 in the professional development of teachers in private 
schools. 
This fund will be allocated to private schools according to the 
number or registered pupils in this way: €95 for every child in 
kindergarten, €145 for every pupil in primary school and €170 
for every pupil in secondary school. We are doing this to keep 
strengthening the private education sector in our country 
because, as we always believed, this sector should keep 
providing an adequate and quality choice to parents in their 
children’s education. This is the first step of a three-year 
programme intended to grow in total consultation with the 
representatives of the operators in this sector. 
For 2012, we are also increasing the allocation for those 
students who need a learning support assistant in private 
schools to 400,000 euro.  
We will also continue helping parents of children who attend 
these schools by increasing the maximum amount of tax 
reduction given to parents who pay school fees for their 
children. Thus these will increase: 
 
62 
 from €1,200 to €1,300 at the level of daycare, reception 
and kindergarten; 
 from €1,200 to €1,600 at primary level; and 
 from €1,600 to €2,300 at secondary level. 
This initiative will cost 600,000 euro.  
6.3 Further and higher education  
Mr. Speaker 
I note with satisfaction the enormous developments made in 
the higher and tertiary education sector, and in particular the 
results from the investment in ITS, MCAST and University, an 
investment the likes of which we have never seen before. This 
success is not only apparent in the number and variety of 
programmes which exist today, academic as well as vocational, 
but also in the substantial increase in the number of students 
who today benefit from continuous education. We note with 
satisfaction that the number of youths who are carrying on with 
their studies after compulsory education is continually on the 
increase. 
We are determined that all Maltese and Gozitan young people 
advance through more programmes and educational and 
training opportunities following compulsory education.  
Stipends and scholarships  
Mr. Speaker 
Our country has a stipends programme to help students carry 
on their studies after secondary school. This year we have 
allocated 22.3 million euro for stipends, and this expenditure 
 
63 
will continue increasing while the number of students is 
increasing. At present we have 18,000 students who receive a 
stipend at University, Junior College, MCAST, and ITS. 
Notwithstanding the criticism sometimes directed at stipends, 
young students and their families who benefit from stipends 
recognise the great help this programme gives them in their 
choice to carry on studying instead of finding a job. 
We will keep investing in more scholarships in various sectors, 
with an allocation of 900,000 euro for more students to further 
their studies. These scholarships allow students to further their 
studies in recognised higher education institutions. 
The University of Malta  
Today there are around 12,000 students at the University of 
Malta. This is a success story which no words can describe. The 
enormous progress which has been made and which the 
University is undergoing cannot only be measured in numbers. 
It is enough to mention the range of courses it offers, the 
international reputation it enjoys with regard to learning and 
research, and the University’s contribution to creativity and 
innovation which are so important for the increase in numbers 
of jobs and in our country’s economic growth. For this 
development to continue with the same rhythm, the recurrent 
expenditure for University and Junior College for next year will 
increase to 58.2 million euro. 
Extensive work is being carried out in the University 
infrastructure through the construction of the new ICT faculty, 
and the Health Biotechnology facilities with an investment of 
7.2 million euro. We are also examining the University’s 
physical infrastructure to see how this can be improved for the 
benefit of our students. 
 
64 
The Old University in Valletta is being transformed into 
another University of Malta Campus, as an International School 
for Graduate Studies as well as a Centre for the study of 
performing arts.  
The Malta College for Arts, Science and Technology, the 
Institute for Tourism Studies and lifelong learning  
MCAST and ITS resulted in a leap in quality in the sectors in 
which they operate as a result of the vocational or specialised 
training they offer. More youths are improving their skills in 
these institutions, while they prepare themselves better for the 
labour market. 
We must sustain this positive development. We are increasing 
the allocation for MCAST to 15.4 million euro so that, among 
other things, it improves the quality of vocational training 
through other courses. This is in addition to having started the 
construction of a new MCAST campus in Kordin which will 
cost 120 million, and which should better satisfy the needs of 
our youths.  
This year we will also implement a programme which will 
increase the accessibility to lifelong learning courses and make 
them more flexible. This project should result in more people 
developing their basic skills and increasing knowledge in 
different sectors of life. This same project will integrate learning 
by means of communication, e-learning, with traditional 
lessons and practical sessions, a programme which is being 
implemented with an investment of 1.5 million euro. 
 
 
 
65 
Strategic choices 
The remarkable progress which occurred in the higher and 
tertiary education sector requires that we make strategic 
decisions to ensure that this sector remains competitive and 
that the quality of the education offered remains of a level 
which is recognised internationally. 
It is time for a historic structural agreement to be reached with 
the University of Malta to safeguard its academic and 
administrative autonomy, so that its property is identified 
clearly and is safeguarded, and so that sustainable financial 
mechanisms are developed which will work for a long period. 
Thus, this established institution will be able to plan for the 
future, and commit its assets to improve learning, research and 
innovation, as well as improve its efforts to attract other 
students, and particularly its development on an international 
level.  
As I have already explained, the investment in MCAST will 
also continue, since this institution has a distinct and crucial 
role in the post-secondary education sector, which is constantly 
growing. It is increasingly important that the developments in 
MCAST take place within the general framework of tertiary 
education in Malta, so that it is ensured that students are given 
the best opportunities. Therefore, the Government is carrying 
out a series of consultative meetings with the parties concerned 
so that we will encourage strategic coordination between the 
University of Malta and MCAST for the good of the two 
institutions and their students. In this context, it is my pleasure 
to note that the collaboration between the University and the 
Institute for Tourism Studies is getting stronger and a good 
number of students who graduated from ITS are furthering 
their tourism studies at the University of Malta. 
 
66 
The Government has just presented the Framework for Quality 
Assurance in the post-secondary Education Sector so that a 
space is established for those who wish to take a more active 
role in post-secondary services in Malta. I reiterate our 
intention to see Malta continue making a name for itself as an 
international centre of quality in the sector, and that we 
continue creating the best environment to attract other 
international students and academics to our country. 
To this end, Government will establish a forum for all operators 
who provide advanced education programmes, public as well 
as private ones. This development should lead to the growth of 
the private sector for quality in advanced education while 
eliminating abuses on the part of a number of operators who do 
not deserve to be called educational institutions. 
6.4 Youth 
Mr. Speaker 
We set up the Youth Agency which is ensuring that young 
people’s perspectives are integrated into each aspect of the 
National Policy. This Agency also administers the National 
Empowerment Programme which gives youths the opportunity 
to develop their skills and talents through non-formal 
education. During next year we will continue to invest in the 
operation of this Agency. 
Mr. Speaker 
A good number of Maltese and Gozitan youths experience and 
learn music in our traditional bands. Because it recognised the 
important role these Societies play in the development of 
youths, in its Electoral Programme this Government promised 
to set up a scheme offering financial assistance to band clubs to 
 
67 
help them in musical training and teaching of youths. This 
promise will be implemented next year, and we are allocating 
100,000 euro for it.    
6.5 Sport 
During this year we gave 5.5 million euro in assistance to sports 
associations. We implemented a number of new schemes, we 
extended the 20/20 scheme to the private sector, and we also 
implemented a scheme to allow national and quality athletes to 
join the Armed Forces under an ad hoc programme which 
allows them to spend a number of hours from their working 
day training in their sporting discipline.  
We also implemented a scheme of Allowances for the Purchase 
of Sports Equipment under which sports organisations were 
refunded 15.25 per cent of their expenditure on this equipment 
bought for use in the training of their athletes, and we again 
issued the scheme for the donation of 15.25 per cent of the sale 
price of bicycles, with the latter benefiting around 900 persons. 
We also carried on with the Sports Tourism scheme to 
incentivise the creation of a niche in this sector to attract 
tourists to our country. In this way sports contributes to the 
country’s economy, while helping sporting activity to become 
more sustainable. In 2010 this scheme attracted to our country 
tourists who used 41,000 bed nights, almost double what we 
had in 2009. We estimate that by the end of this year more than 
70,000 bed nights will have been used by tourists under this 
scheme. For next year, we are allocating 350,000 euro to 
continue attracting more sports tourism. 
We also strengthened the scheme for Sports Initiatives for Local 
Councils so as to increase the sports culture in communities. 
 
68 
This year 29 Local Councils participated and they organised 
various sporting and physical education activities in their 
localities.  
Mr. Speaker 
We have reached another quality leap so that sports will 
continue establishing itself in Maltese culture. As from the next 
academic year, we will establish a specialised secondary school 
for sport. This school will be attended by female and male 
athletes who, while being given academic training in all 
subjects, will also have enough time to train in their respective 
sporting discipline, even during school hours. Besides this, they 
will have the opportunity to learn academic subjects related to 
sport. Thus, we will be addressing a gap we have had up to 
now in the sports sector, where promising athletes lose their 
physical and sporting development because of a lack of time for 
training during their secondary school years. For this project to 
begin as planned, we are allocating 100,000 euro.  
We are also allocating 120,000 euro for scholarships in the 
sports sector so that those who show promise and who are up 
to it can continue investing in their sporting skills even abroad.  
We are allocating 350,000 euro for the Maltese Council for 
Sports and Transport Malta so they can work with 
representatives of motorsport enthusiasts to help in the 
development of an adequate circuit for training and 
competitions connected to karting, mini motos, quad bikes, 
motards, scooters, as well as for the tuning of vehicles which 
participate in hill climbs.  
 
 
 
69 
Mr. Speaker 
Our children and young people are full of potential and we 
have the duty to invest in them so that they can develop. That is 
what we have done these past years in various fields: in 
education, in youth work, in the teaching of the arts, as well as 
in sports. The positive results which are being achieved fill us 
with the determination to carry on. 
 
 
7. 
The family and the social sector  
7.1 The social sector 
Mr. Speaker 
The family is the core of our society. What the family gives 
cannot be given by anyone else. Our job is to sustain families in 
order for them to give their best to their children and to the 
other family members. The responsibility, the professionalism, 
and the determination we have used allow us to carry on with 
our commitment to Maltese and Gozitan families. 
In this budget, we are proposing to increase the direct aid 
granted to families with children as well as to the most 
vulnerable senior citizens who worked so hard to build our 
country. We are also proposing a number of social measures 
which will keep nurturing the web of solidarity which protects 
those Maltese and Gozitans who are most in need. 
That is why the expenditure in the social sector out of National 
Funds this year went up to 989.2 million euro. Thus far in this 
Budget we are proposing to increase this expenditure by 37.9 
million to 1.02 billon euro. 
 
70 
Increase in the minimum rate for children’s allowance   
Mr. Speaker 
Government recognises the need to sustain our families, mostly 
in the strong contribution they give to society when raising 
children. Therefore we are increasing the Children’s Allowance 
minimum rate by €100 to €350 a year for each child. This 
represents an investment of 2.8 million euro.  
Removal of television licences  
As from next year we will remove television licences and thus 
we will implement an electoral promise. Justice requires that 
those with an outstanding unpaid licence be asked to regularise 
their position, and a scheme will be implemented for them to be 
able to do this and thus avoid paying additional fines. The 
removal of this licence will leave around four million euro in 
our families’ pockets. 
Social benefits and COLA 
As we did in the previous budget, each benefit will increase by 
the COLA amount. Thus, 112,000 beneficiaries will benefit from 
a higher benefit rate. This also applies for the benefit means test 
and non-contributory benefits, among them supplementary 
assistance, the energy benefit, and the pink card. 
We are doing this so that no benefits are lost, particularly for 
pensioners who, because of the pension increase, will lose the 
sickness benefit. 
Meanwhile, we intensified our commitment to reduce the abuse 
of 
social 
benefits. 
Since 
we 
established 
the 
Benefit 
Fraud and Investigation Department, more than 4,340 cases of 
 
71 
undue benefits were discovered. We estimate that through this 
commitment our country could invest 21.2 million euro in what 
is really needed by Maltese and Gozitan families. 
Widow’s and widower’s pension  
Five years ago we decided that a widower or widow who 
remarries will remain entitled to a fixed rate of the widow’s or 
widower’s pension for the first five years after remarrying. We 
feel that the five-year limit should be increased by a year, each 
year, from now on. Thus, a widower or widow who remained 
entitled to a fixed rate of the widow’s or widower’s pension 
after remarrying will not lose this pension after having been 
remarried for more than five years.  
Disabled Persons 
Mr. Speaker 
We have made big advances in the disability sector. We also 
realise that equally big challenges are left, mostly in the sector 
of the training and employment of severely disabled persons as 
well as in a support service for those disabled persons who 
cannot live with their families any longer. 
Besides the increase in assistance to various voluntary 
associations in this sector, our commitment towards this sector 
will continue with these measures: 
 
1. As from next year, disabled persons who receive a severe 
disability pension will be able to work and earn up to the 
minimum wage without losing any of their pension. The 
severe disability pension must not serve as a disincentive 
 
72 
to work but should cover a few of the expenses 
connected to the disability; 
 
2. For the past five years, when a person who received a 
severe disability pension got married, he/she did not lose 
the pension because of his/her wife’s/husband’s income 
for the first five years of marriage. Now we will remove 
the limit so that a severely disabled person who gets 
married never loses his/her pension because of his/her 
wife’s/husband’s income; 
 
3. We will also increase the allocation to the agency 
SAPPORT for it to open a new branch in Pembroke, 
where disabled persons will be given more training and 
work experiences. We will also remain committed to help 
in the running of residential homes, for example Dar 
Pirotta, and now also Dar il-Wens and Dar l-Arka; and 
 
4. At present, the National Commission for Disabled 
Persons is finalising a report about the development 
which is needed in our country for severely disabled 
persons to have the required support not to become 
institutionalised. For this sector to carry out the 
necessary developments, the Government is allocating 
the sum of two million euro over a five-year period, with 
this year’s sum being 400,000 euro.   
Further assistance to the voluntary activities 
Mr. Speaker 
This is the European year dedicated to the voluntary sector. I 
am happy to say that in Malta we have an impressive number 
of voluntary organizations which are offering various services 
 
73 
to our communities in the social, environmental, educational 
and sports sectors, among others. Certainly various voluntary 
organizations manage to help vulnerable persons and families 
when the State alone does not manage.  
In 1994 Government had set up a Fund to continue supporting 
these organisations in their commendable work as part of the 
social inclusion strategy. Since their setting up, more than 26 
million euro in financial assistance have been given to this 
important sector, which resulted in assistance to thousands of 
vulnerable families and persons. 
We must continue strengthening this sector. Therefore, after we 
had allocated 2.4 million euro to this Fund this year, we are 
proposing an increase of half a million euro for next year.  
I ask the House to consider Table 7.1, which gives a list of 
contributions to voluntary organisations in 2011, as read.

The housing sector 
Mr. Speaker 
In the housing sector, Government policy promotes that 
everyone becomes a home-owner. Where this is impossible it 
helps vulnerable persons to have a decent residence. We believe 
that there is a wider role for the private sector in the provision 
of rented accommodation.  
The Housing Authority offers various schemes that help 
families in need to improve the conditions of their residence. It 
 
75 
offers other schemes which give a rental subsidy to whoever 
rents from the private sector, schemes for first-time buyers, or 
for those who need to rent an alternative place from 
Government. Since 2008 we have renovated more than 1,800 
residences for an investment of four million euro through 
renovation schemes.  
The Authority also gives subsidies on rentals from the private 
sector. From this scheme of around a million euro a year, about 
1,200 families benefit every year. Now we are taking another 
step. The Housing Authority will permit home-owners to 
register with the Authority a property which they wish to rent, 
according to certain conditions laid down by the Authority 
itself, to the families which qualify for the rental subsidy. The 
rentals registered under this scheme will benefit from a 
preferential rate for final withholding tax on rental income of 10 
per cent. Thus we will strengthen the scheme which the 
Authority already implements while giving additional peace of 
mind to the owners as well as to the tenants.  
We will keep working on initiatives which offer assistance to 
first-time buyers by, among others, easing the payment of loans 
for buying. Assistance is also being given for the building, 
renovation and continuation of the first residence. The latter is 
always popular, with an average of 350 applications a year, and 
an expenditure of 3.5 million euro these past 4 years. 
 
 
Scheme to make more families home owners 
Mr. Speaker 
The Government will continue to help families become home 
owners.   
 
76 
During this year, we have started a process to pay the original 
land owners whose lands had been expropriated in the 
seventies and eighties and which lands were used for the 
building of homes under the Home Ownership Schemes. By an 
investment of five million euro over the last two years, around 
500 families became home owners after more than 30 years 
since the promise of sale had been entered into.   
It is now time for a further step forward.   
It is calculated that there are around 3,000 families who are not 
home owners since they live in accommodation built by the 
Government over land expropriated after the War under a title 
of possession and use.   
The Government cares about these families, as it cares about the 
families of the heirs of the original owners of the buildings 
which had been demolished during the war.   
For this reason, we are allocating 1.8 million so that the Lands 
Department capitalises on the acquisition rent which has been 
paid over the last decades. We have around 2,800 residences in 
Valletta and Cottonera, and we will give the possibility to the 
families living inside them to purchase the properties in which 
they reside.   
7.2 The best health service for everyone 
In Malta, the health sector is a source of support for Maltese 
families. Anyone who requires public health services is aware 
of what this entails. These services, together with those offered 
by the family doctor in our homes and by other private 
operators, are part of the foundations which protect our 
country’s social fabric.   
 
77 
Everybody is able to notice the investment made in the health 
sector. Every family is aware of someone who has benefited 
from this investment. We want the best health service for 
Maltese and Gozitan families.     
Expenditure in this sector is on the increase. For the coming 
year, we are allocating 37.6 million euro more than this year’s 
allocation, for a total expenditure of 415.9 million euro.  
The cancer treatment 
We have established cancer treatment as being a primary 
priority. This is an illness which is affecting all our families and 
we need a national effort to combat it.   
The National Cancer Plan strategy focuses on the patients’ 
needs as well as on their families’ needs. This Plan has the aim 
of reducing the incidence of cancer, and of ensuring a better 
quality of life for patients by offering services of a higher level.    
The national Breast Screening program is now in its fourth year. 
This Program is leading to the early identification of breast 
cancer with positive results.     
Next year, we will make another major step forward through a 
colorectal screening program. This new Program is meant to 
identify cancer in its earliest stage so as to avoid related deaths. 
The construction of an Oncology Centre at Mater Dei Hospital 
has commenced, which will cater for 74 patients as in-patients 
and 22 more patients in day care. This Centre should start 
receiving its first patients in mid-2013.   
Until this new Centre is completed, we have continued to 
improve the services at Sir Paul Boffa Hospital. During this 
year, we have inaugurated a palliative care ward and we have 
 
78 
extended palliative care services in the community. We have 
invested in the building of a new bunker and in a new linear 
accelerator. This equipment started being used in the past 
weeks with huge benefits for patients and employees alike.    
More operations and a reduction in the waiting lists through 
partnerships with the private sector 
Mr. Speaker 
A major goal in the health sector is the increase in operations, as 
well as a reduction in the waiting lists for operations. This is a 
major challenge. The results we are attaining are evidence that 
the Government and all the health care employees’ efforts are 
reaping the desired results.   
32,764 operations were carried out in the last full year in which 
St. Luke’s hospital was operational. In 2010, 41,795 operations 
were carried out, which means an increase of 9,031 operations. 
The indications for this year show that this year will be even 
better.   
Naturally, we will not stop here. We have reached an 
agreement with the private sector, particularly on PET scans, 
operations such as cataract operations and others, so as to 
continue decreasing the waiting time. In the coming year, we 
will also focus on hip replacement operations.  
Today we are carrying out operations of the highest level at 
Mater Dei Hospital. We have professionals who are making 
Mater Dei Hospital a hospital of such high quality that it is able 
to compete with the best hospitals in Europe. We are entering 
into agreements with consultants who work in some of the best 
hospitals in Europe for them to offer their services in our 
hospital. This will enable us to extend the number of services 
 
79 
that we offer in our hospitals. I must also mention the 
Foundation Programme through which Maltese doctors are 
opting to further their studies in Malta, while foreign doctors 
are coming to study in our country.   
Medicines and the pharmacy of your choice 
In the medicines sector, we are making a reform of the fifth and 
second schedules so that hundreds of persons who suffer from 
chronic conditions, and who so far have no assistance in buying 
their medicines, will now start benefiting from a number of free 
medicines.     
We will continue to extend the Pharmacy of Your Choice 
scheme. A few days ago, we added 15 new pharmacies in the 
South of Malta to the scheme which are together providing 
services to another 4,000 persons. This means that 60,000 
persons will be served from 129 pharmacies of their choice.   
Primary Care 
Mr. Speaker 
Malta has top quality primary care services thanks to the family 
doctor. This is a private service, through which Maltese families 
receive the service of a doctor in the comfort of their own 
homes. Little do we appreciate the value of this service. The 
Government is determined to strengthen the services given at 
Health Centres in a manner which complements the private 
service of the family doctor.   
For this purpose, a number of Health Centres are being 
refurbished so that that the family doctor will be able to find in 
the Health Centres those services which can help him offer the 
best service to Maltese and Gozitan families.   
 
80 
In health promotion, besides a number of educational and 
informational campaigns addressing our need to take care of 
our health, a national sexual health policy was launched. Next 
year we will launch a strategy for obesity prevention for all 
ages.   
Mental health 
Mr. Speaker 
The mental health sector will make huge progress as a result of 
the Mental Health Act, which passed the first reading stage in 
Parliament a few weeks ago. During the last three years, we 
have continued to extend mental health community care and 
today we have around 130 professionals working in the 
community in this sector. We have extended the services to 40 
localities and three new day centres have been inaugurated in 
Żejtun, Paola, and Floriana so that we now have five day 
centres for mental health care in Paola, Kirkop and Floriana.   
These services, together with other services, are providing help 
so that fewer people need enter Mount Carmel Hospital, and 
when they do, the time for which they are kept in this hospital 
has been reduced considerably.   
For the coming year, we are allocating 450,00 euro so that the 
service will continue to extend in the community, and so that 
we will be able to open another day centre and clinic in Gżira. 
We also intend to extend this service to Mosta, Rabat, and 
Birkirkara. 
A number of flats are being allocated for the supportive 
housing scheme through the Housing Authority. Such flats may 
accommodate a number of patients who leave Mount Carmel 
Hospital.    
 
81 
Furthermore, after the establishment of the Crisis Intervention 
Team this year, a number of crisis interventions in cases related 
to mental health problems have taken place. In the coming year, 
we will continue to strengthen this service and we are thus 
allocating 100,000 euro.  
We will also establish a new service aimed towards adolescents 
suffering from mental health problems so that they will also be 
given community care.  
 
7.3 The elderly  
Mr. Speaker 
It was the elderly who built the quality of life which we enjoy 
today, and society has the duty to ensure, in every possible 
way, that the elderly remain at the core of Maltese society. The 
Government has adopted a policy to incentivise active 
participation in all sectors of society. Currently, thousands of 
elderly persons remain in employment without losing revenue 
from their pensions. Hundreds of elderly people contribute in 
no small measure to parishes, Local Councils, voluntary 
organisations and public boards. The subsidised public 
transport service, which is spread throughout Malta and Gozo, 
is allowing the elderly to gain access to all cities and villages. 
The elderly are, above all, a large resource. We should look at 
the ever-growing number of elderly persons not only as a 
challenge, but also as an opportunity. 
Government policy in this sector translates into all measures 
which increase participation of the elderly in all sectors of 
Maltese society, and includes special initiatives for elderly 
 
82 
persons requiring most support. This policy is set to continue 
being strengthened even through the following measures: 
.   Once again this year, pensioners will be given the full 
cost of living increase. 
2.   Age presents elderly people who wish to keep living an 
independent life in their own homes with difficult 
challenges. In order to help elderly people live 
independent lives in their own homes, we are giving a 
new €300 a year grant to every elderly person over 80 
living in their own home or with their family. This 
initiative will cost 3.5 million euro, and will benefit 
nearly 12,000 elderly persons. Therefore, through this 
grant and the full cost of living increase, every elderly 
person over 80 will receive an increase of over €10 a 
week. 
3.   VAT on private nursing and home help offered by the 
private sector to the elderly in their private homes will be 
removed as from the 1st of January 2012. 
4.  A few years ago we introduced an income tax exemption 
for relatives of elderly people helping their parents live 
in private nursing homes. As from next year, this 
initiative will be increased by 500 euro to 2,500 euro.  
5.  We will build on what we did in previous years 
regarding service pensions, and we will extend this 
measure by a further €200. The total cost is of one million 
euro; and 
6.  The elderly and persons who are tax exempt and who 
pay 15 percent withholding tax will start receiving 
refunds of tax paid without completing a tax form. 
 
83 
Care of the elderly 
The demand for more accommodation is continuously 
increasing in the area of the care of the elderly. As announced, 
Zammit Clapp Hospital will start to operate as a nursing home, 
and the necessary work is being carried out.   
Following the investment made in John Paul II Block of the St 
Vincent de Paule Residence, which currently accommodates 
144 residents, a works programme for the refurbishment of 
other wards will continue next year. 
Government has also earmarked land in Birkirkara for the 
construction of a new residence for the elderly, based on the 
same lines as the residence for the elderly in Mellieħa. The 
required application process with MEPA will commence with 
immediate effect. 
Additionally, we have continued purchasing a number of beds 
from the private sector so as to increase the number of places 
for elderly people who require this service.  
After launching the Night Shelter pilot project in Żejtun, we 
also extended this service to Mellieħa, and discussions are 
currently being held with Church entities and Local Councils 
with the aim of opening other Night Shelters in other localities. 
We will continue to invest in Day Care Centres for the elderly. 
This year we opened new centres in Mellieħa and Msida. So far, 
we have 18 centres around Malta, in which 1,500 elderly people 
participate on a regular basis. For next year, we are 
allocating118,000 euro to open two other centres. 
 
 
 
84 
The treatment of dementia 
Mr. Speaker 
Dementia is a condition that is afflicting an increasing number 
of elderly people. That is why our country now has a national 
dementia strategy. This strategy gave rise to a number of 
important initiatives, among which: 
• A new block at St Vincent de Paule with dementia 
friendly wards;    
• Training for workers and carers working in areas related 
to dementia; 
• Day Respite for patients in the community suffering from 
dementia; 
• Services from the memory clinic at the Karen Grech 
Hospital for people suffering from dementia;  
• A helpline for use by the public, with the collaboration of 
the Malta Dementia Society; and 
• The publication of an educational children’s book about 
dementia affecting relatives. 
Government is committed to keep providing care, and to help 
those suffering from this condition. We are allocating 200,000 
euro in order that medicines for the treatment of dementia can 
be provided for free.  
 
 
 
85 
7.4 
Police 
In this budget we will continue to invest in and further equip 
the Police Force. For us, the fight against crime and illegal 
activity remains a priority and, although we have seen better 
control of and stronger action against crime, the Police Force 
remains in continuous need of more instruments. Therefore, as 
has already been done in previous years, we will ensure that 
even this year the Force will continue being equipped with new 
and modern equipment, new vehicles and technologically 
advanced tools which help directly in the fight against crime.  
The continuation of the building of the new Police Academy 
remains a priority. The training of the members and recruits 
being admitted every year remains of vital and determining 
importance. This will continue ensuring a greater success in an 
ever-changing world in which criminal organisations do not 
only operate in one country, but in a number of different 
countries simultaneously. The capital vote for the construction 
of the Police Academy will increase by 600,000 euro. 
 
86 
8. Conclusion 
Mr Speaker 
This is the plan we drew up to help us face the turbulence that 
surrounds us.  
This Budget, which I have presented before the House in the 
name of the Government this evening, can be summarised in 
the following five main goals: 
 We must ensure our country’s stability; 
 we must safeguard and increase jobs for our workers; 
 we want our children and our people to develop all their 
skills; 
 we 
must 
embellish 
and 
protect 
our 
country’s 
environment; 
 we must protect our families and vulnerable people. 
In all this, we have chosen to be cautious, focussed, disciplined 
and responsible. We should not take apart what our people 
have built. We have chosen to do what is right and what our 
country needs. 
Together with these values, we are guided by the strong trust 
which we have in our people and in our country.   
Yes Mr Speaker, the Maltese are an able people, an industrious 
people and a diligent people. We believe in our people, and we 
believe in our country. 
 
 
 
87 
Mr. Speaker 
This budget provides the strong leadership which our country 
needs in order to face every challenge that we encounter. The 
Government is sure that with diligence and responsibility we 
will overcome the adversity which the world is facing.
