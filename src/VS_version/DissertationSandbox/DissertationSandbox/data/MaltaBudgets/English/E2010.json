Speaker, Today we are commemorating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.", "This was an event which transformed the European continent as well as the rest of the world.", "On that day, the political structure was shaken to its roots.", "That was the birth of a new Europe.", "This year the global financial and economic system has been shaken.", "Faced with this reality, in this House we must carefully weigh our reaction.", "We could choose the easy way, by looking away and saying \u201dNo.", "There is nothing going on.", "We don\u2019t need to do anything.\u201d Otherwise we can, prudently, responsibly and courageously, look towards the horizon and say \u201dYes, the world is changing, but our people are capable of facing these challenges.", "Together we can overcome them.\u201d Mr Speaker, This evening, this Government will once more choose the second option.", "This Government acts responsibly towards its people.", "This Government works prudently and does not shy away.", "This Government does not believe that challenges are won by saying that they do not exist.", "Because we want the best for our people, we are ready to face these 5 challenges, the international economic situation, climate change, the problem of energy security, demographic developments and immigration.", "Mr.", "Speaker, In a world which has been turned upside down, there are also things which for this Government never change.", "These are the foundations of our policies and include total respect of human dignity, our duty as a society to support each other, the value of the family, and the promotion of the common good.", "These are the foundations on which we wish to build our Vision 2015.", "This Budget is another step towards this Vision.", "6 Overview of the economy and financial sustainability The international economy Mr.", "Speaker, our country enjoys an open economy.", "International economic developments inevitably have a direct impact on it.", "2009 has been a difficult year with huge challenges.", "International commerce has decreased substantially.", "This resulted in high unemployment rates in several countries.", "The European Commission is forecasting that the Gross Domestic Product in the Eurozone will shrink by about 4 per cent.", "Several governments and central banks have intervened to support their economies.", "It appears that the worst of the crisis is over and that the rate of economic growth will continue to recover slowly.", "However, there is still plenty of economic uncertainty.", "International financial markets are still struggling.", "The price of several raw materials, including oil, has started to rise again.", "The economy in Malta Mr.", "Speaker, Even economic activity in Malta has been badly affected by the international recession.", "The demand for products manufactured in Malta, as well as for our tourist product, 7 has decreased.", "At the same time, certain sectors in the services industry have kept growing, proof of the success of our policy with regard to economic diversification.", "Economic troubles also affected investment, while private consumption decreased.", "As a result of this, we expect that the Maltese economy will shrink by 2 per cent.", "This also had an impact on the employment market.", "The number of people registering for work in September stood at 7,521.", "Table 2.1 shows how the gainfully employed in our country, between December 2008 and June 2009, increased in every economic sector except manufacturing and the tourism sector.", "Here I must remind you that had Government not intervened to support these two sectors, we would not have saved as many jobs.", "Table 2.1 Gainfully Employed Persons Sector 2007 (Jan-Dec) 2008 (Jan-Dec) 2009 (Jan-Jun) Construction

there are jobs to be saved.", "Mr.", "Speaker, in this budget, Government will be announcing a number of new initiatives which will not only create work, but help in the training and integration of those people who are looking for work.", "Last September, the rate of inflation stood at 3.5 per cent.", "This is a reduction of about 2.0 percentage points compared to September 2008.", "Although local inflation is somewhat high, this is showing downward trends.", "Notwithstanding this, we will keep working towards the convergence of our rate of inflation with that of the Eurozone.", "A more detailed analysis of the economic situation can be found in the Economic Survey which I am tabling in the House.", "The Gross Domestic Product for 2009 is expected to decrease by 2 per cent.", "The rate of inflation according to the Retail Price Index should go up to about 2.5 per cent.", "During 2010 it is expected that the economic rhythm of major economies will have started to improve and that the demand for our exports will again start growing.", "9 Therefore, it is expected that next year the Maltese economy will grow by about 1.1 per cent, while the unemployment rate will decrease slightly.", "The rate of inflation is expected to be 2 per cent.", "Cost of living adjustment Mr.", "Speaker, the cost of living adjustment, calculated on the inflation which resulted from the Retail Price Index and according to the methodology agreed upon by the social partners, will be \u20ac5.82 a week.", "The financial situation during 2009 and beyond Government deficit for the year 2009 is expected to be 217.6 million euro, or 3.79 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product, owing to several factors.", "Direct taxes are expected to increase by 22 million euro, over the original estimate for 2009, when one includes the effect of the initiative announced for the collection of income tax due.", "We expect a decrease of 35 million euro from indirect taxes, mainly because of the decrease in economic activity.", "Non-tax revenue is also expected to decrease.", "An increase of 119 million euro is expected over the original estimate for 2009 in the different categories of Recurrent Expenditure.", "90 million euro of these are Programmes and Initiatives that include payments connected to the Shipyards process and the increase in funds allocated to the health sector.", "With regard to Contributions to Government Entities, there will be an increase of 14 million euro, including increases related to the education sector.", "Capital Expenditure is expected to reach 303 million euro till the end of the year.", "On the other hand, we expect an increase in expenditure for other services, including aid given to industry to compensate for the effects of the decrease in economic activity.", "By the end of 2009, Government debt is expected to be 67 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product, 11 per cent less than the Eurozone average.", "Tables 2.2 to 2.4 detail the financial situation.", "Table No 2.2 Financial Position 2008-2009\n Consolidated Fund Position Total Revenue 2,302,145 2,551,318 2,466,648 Tax Revenue 2,098,311 2,238,263 2,225,653 Non-Tax Revenue

as read.", "Further details are found in Appendix E attached to this speech.", "Public Debt for the coming 3 years will follow the same trend of Government deficit and, as shown in Table 2.4, which I ask the House to consider as read, will register 68.7, 68.2 and 67.2 percent of the Gross Domestic Product for the years 2010 to 2012, respectively.", "Structural Reforms Mr.", "Speaker, during this year we have carried on our structural reforms so as to make our country more efficient and competitive.", "We carried out a number of initiatives in the education and lifelong learning sector.", "We implemented a number of initiatives to encourage and integrate more women or disadvantaged people in the labour market.", "We implemented other initiatives to make work more attractive for everyone.", "We improved our physical, fiscal and IT infrastructure, and we helped industries.", "We also helped our families to introduce systems for better and more efficient energy use.", "A list of these measures and initiatives is attached in Appendix A.", "We launched the reform of MEPA to ensure an increasingly transparent and sustainable planning service for our country.", "We are also progressing steadily in the implementation of our strategy in the area of informatics and of financial services.", "We have also launched a big project to connect our country to the European electricity grid.", "We are launching our strategy to make Gozo an ecological island.", "Mr.", "Speaker, We have done and are doing all this, and more, to strengthen our markets and improve the competitivity of our country.", "Economic Strategy Mr.", "Speaker, Government is reacting to the international economic turmoil, while remaining focused on the implementation of the Vision we have developed for our country.", "During the past months, we began an extensive consultation process, with the help of a group of international consultants, to renew Vision 2015.", "Government is committed to make of our country a centre of excellence in a number of economic areas where we have an economic advantage.", "Work on the renewal of this strategy is in full swing and it is expected that, during the coming year, we will be in a position to publish a document regarding this for public consultation.", "Government intends to organise the Maltese Economic Forum, to which we shall invite Maltese people who have been successful in various economic sectors abroad to share with us their experiences and to entice them to invest in our country.", "This Government\u2019s strategy, while addressing immediate challenges, must remain spurred on by Vision 2015, and therefore, while we make the necessary choices, we must not prejudice the economic stability which we need to face bigger challenges.", "Everybody, including the Government, wishes that 2009 was a better year.", "However, notwithstanding the difficulties we faced, we achieved results.", "Above all, we managed to reduce the impact caused by the international economic crisis.", "This was possible as in the past we had taken important timely decisions.", "We introduced the euro, a decision which served as an anchor of stability for our country during the economic and financial crisis.", "We carried out the necessary reforms which, while not necessarily rendering us popular, were necessary for us to be prepared for the challenges we are facing.", "We introduced reforms in electricity and water rates.", "We are in the process of privatising the shipyard and of reforming public transport.", "We took many difficult decisions, without letting the deficit run out of control.", "Today everyone can see the consequences of huge deficits.", "Many countries are having to increase direct and indirect taxes substantially over a number of years to compensate for their big deficits.", "Mr.", "Speaker, We must remain prudent and responsible.", "We cannot stop considering the deficit as a problem.", "We cannot believe the tale that we are keeping the deficit under control to please someone.", "A high deficit eats away at investment and work.", "We are working to keep the deficit at an acceptable level to increase the economic prospects for our country as well as not to increase the burdens which our family and our children must carry.", "Those countries which had to increase their deficit hugely are now taking drastic fiscal measures, including the introduction of new taxes, when the recovery from the recession has still not happened.", "What we did was calculated and wise.", "We did not fall for the temptation to help everyone, regardless of necessity, so as to increase our popularity.", "On the contrary, we sought to seriously help those who needed our full support.", "That is what we did when we introduced the energy grants to help our needy families.", "That is what we did when we helped factories which needed help.", "And that is what we shall carry on doing.", "Because that is what reason, wisdom and prudence dictate.", "Mr Speaker, The 2010 Budget is based on these six aims : 1.", "We must increase economic and fiscal stability, price stability and increase competition in our markets; 2.", "We must incentivize productive investment to create prosperity and work; 3.", "We must continue investing in our health and in our social security so that everybody in our country can progress; 4.", "We must continue investing in our education and training to keep building on the talents, the capability and the wisdom of our people; 5.", "We must continue investing in the infrastructure of our country, in our environment, in our roads, in our historical and cultural heritage, and in economic sectors which are profitable so that we can sustain the economic and social progress of our people; and 6.", "We must continue implementing our Vision for Gozo as an ecological Island.", "Government\u2019s fiscal policy Government\u2019s fiscal policy is not the increase of tax burdens.", "On the contrary, in these past years, and particularly in the last three budgets, we launched a substantial Income Tax reform, which resulted in Government leaving 152 million euro in the pockets of workers and businesses.", "Certainly these measures were an essential factor which allowed Malta to weather the storm of the past few months.", "However, in order that the fiscal policy of Government not to increase tax burdens was to be possible, the conviction that Government must not give subsidies where these are not necessary must be the conviction of us all.", "We need courage to implement what we declare we believe.", "If not, whoever is in Government will have to search for funds to sustain those sectors which are most dear to the country, such as education and health, among others.", "With this aim, during 2010, Government will take a number of measures to restrict its expenditure, as well as other measures to strengthen the enforcement of fiscal laws.", "In this way we will be able to reach our aims for this budget without the necessity of new taxes.", "The economic situation and the need to use our resources to sustain and create work, do not allow us to reduce income tax in this budget.", "However, Government still believes it must continue implementing at least parts of its Electoral Programme.", "Therefore, from 1 January, the \u20ac16.31 levy on credit cards will be removed.", "As a result of this measure, which will reduce Government revenue by two million euro a year, 120,000 people are expected to benefit.", "Fees for the registration and licensing of power boats will be reduced as shown in Table 2.5 below which I ask the House to consider as read.", "It is estimated that from this measure, which will result in a loss of revenue of 150,000 euro, around 16,000 people will benefit.", "Table 2.5 Revision of tariffs for the registration and licensing of boats Category Present Fee \u20ac Proposed Fee \u20ac Present Annual Fee \u20ac

continue with the fiscal consolidation process, we have decided to take the following actions: 1.", "Where possible, the financial estimates for 2010 were either retained at the same level as this year, or have been reduced in a bid to reduce expenditure; 2.", "The number of workers who shall be recruited in the public sector during the coming year shall be substantially less than the number of workers who are leaving the public service, either due to resignations or because they have reached retiring age.", "This action will reduce public expenditure by around 10 million euro; 3.", "Government entities having the potential to generate revenue from the sector in which they operate should no longer be dependent on Government subvention.", "For this reason, a new tariff structure for MEPA issued permits will come in force resulting in this entity not receiving central government funds.", "4.", "We are intensifying efforts against any kind of fraud in the income and expenditure of Government, including those related to abuses from social benefits.", "Till September of this year, 861 benefits have been stopped, reaching a value of 3.1 million euro per year; 5.", "There shall be a strengthening of Government efforts to recover its money and to reduce tax evasion and fiscal abuse; and 6.", "We shall also increase the duty on cigarettes between 6.55 and 6.84 percent, namely \u20ac0.15c.", "Tax on other tobacco products shall be based along the same lines as this increase.", "From this measure, the Government shall generate 3.7 million euro.", "A new fiscal and budgetary framework Mr Speaker, the Financial Administration and Audit Act shall be updated, with the underlying aim of strengthening the fiscal and budgetary policy and framework, so as to cater further towards the desired objectives and results.", "and to enhance transparency and accountability.", "During 2010, Government shall continue working towards strengthening the country\u2019s financial and budgetary framework.", "There shall also be a further strengthening of the monitoring and financial evaluation system in the public sector.", "At the same time, a call for tenders shall be issued for the procurement of an accounting system for Government.", "Incentivizing productive investment for job creation Mr Speaker, In the coming years, we shall experience new economic realities and for this reason we must shape our strategy to address these challenges.", "The work challenges are not insignificant.", "We must make every effort to encourage investment, both Maltese and foreign.", "We must provide incentives for those who want to start a business, expand or renew their activities and encourage them to do so in new markets and by seizing new opportunities.", "Incentives for the industry and enterprise in 2010 Economic development Mr Speaker, in order to be better equipped to do so, we shall continue transforming Malta Enterprise so that it becomes an agency of wider economic development incorporating: \u2022 enterprise development and the provision of integrated services meeting the needs of all those undertaking an economic activity; \u2022 the promotion of foreign and local investment, with an emphasis on new markets, new sectors having a high added value; and \u2022 the facilitating of business and granting of assistance to enterprises to engage in international business.", "To this end, we shall increase Malta Enterprise\u2019s allocation from 4.9 million to 5.6 million euro.", "Incentives for enterprises Mr Speaker, during this year we shall have invested around 20 million euro to help our industry enter new markets, in providing allowances for research and development, in providing assistance to small and medium-sized companies in renovating their processes, products and services, in schemes to help fledgling innovative companies and in grants to motivate the use of information technology in companies\u2019 operations.", "We have also allocated 10 million euro to assist in the investment towards renewable energy and for improving the efficient use of energy.", "After the success witnessed in these schemes, Government has decided to extend the 20millionforindustry scheme by allocating 7 million euro, so that we shall have allocated a total of 37 million euro in allowances to the industry and which shall be allocated in the following manner: International Competitiveness 2 million euro Innovation 3 million euro Research and Innovation 1 million euro e-business 1 million euro In 2010, we shall issue a fresh call for the Environment scheme wherein the 1.5 million euro which had not been allocated, shall be decided upon.", "Where foreign investment is involved, we believe that the international recession provides new opportunities for international companies which are presently focusing more on controlling expenses than on expanding their operations.", "At the same time, we must provide incentives for the creation of new industries and industries with a high added value in our country, aside from helping foreign investors already operating in Malta to further fortify their operations.", "To this end, Mr Speaker, Government is increasing Malta Enterprise\u2019s incentive allowance from 6.6 million euro to 9 million euro, so that amongst other things, we launch three new initiatives to encourage foreign investment towards our country: 1.", "We shall encourage foreign investors already operating in Malta to bring to Malta vertical activities to their existing operations, including legal, financial, back office, corporative, logistical, research and development, marketing and sales, and prototyping services; 2.", "We shall encourage new foreign companies to set up shared services centres in areas such as call centres, software development, digital gaming, human resources, accounts and finance management, market research and Internet publication; and 3.", "We shall renew and add to those enterprises eligible for fiscal incentives given under the 2005 Reinvestment Tax Credit (Income Tax) Rules, which consist in a tax credit which is given whenever profits are re-invested in a project approved by Malta Enterprise.", "Reserve Fund for Assisting Enterprises Mr Speaker, On the basis of the experience gained during this year, we are also allocating the sum of 2.5 million euro in a Reserve Fund for Assisting Enterprises so that we can be able to assist when temporary difficulties arise in enterprises having a viable future, and which are ready to invest in their future.", "The development of industrial areas Mr Speaker, Malta Industrial Parks has also become responsible for areas where a minor industry has been created on private land in different areas around Malta and Gozo.", "In 2010 we shall invest more than 16 million euro in the Kordin, \u0126al-Far, Bulebel, Mosta and Xewkija industrial areas, whereas by virtue of a partnership with the private sector, two micro-enterprise parks in Mellie\u0127a and Xewkija Gozo will be set up.", "Research and innovation Mr Speaker, With the aim of reaching our targets in the context of Vision 2015, we believe that it is crucial to seriously encourage the research and innovation sector.", "Further investment in this sector will create more quality jobs.", "In this context, and in order to fulfil the strategy published for this area, and the electoral promises, we are allocating 1.7 million euro so as to: \u2022 Double the Research and Innovation Fund to 700,000 euro; \u2022 Devise a National Strategy for the Development of the Digital Gaming Industry from the Maltese Council for Science and Technology, Malta Enterprise and the University of Malta, towards which we are allocating 250,000 euro; \u2022 Invest a further 250,000 euro to set up a databank regarding the Genome Uman by means of a partnership between the Maltese Council for Science and Technology, Malta Enterprise and the University of Malta; \u2022 Grant an allowance of half a million euro to the University of Malta to set up the Malta University Research, Innovation and Development Trust Fund with the aim of encouraging research at the University and to help in its use for commercial and industrial purposes.", "Whoever gives a donation of not less than 150 euro, shall be entitled to a reduction of the same amount from the taxable revenue up to a maximum of 50,000 euro; \u2022 Give a refund of 15.2 percent on expenses on which tax has been paid on research projects approved by the Ministry of Finance and the the Maltese Council for Science and Technology; \u2022 Give another substantial incentive for persons and entities undertaking research leading to patents covering their inventions.", "This benefit shall consist in a tax exemption from royalties and similar revenue, up to a maximum amount to be established, resulting from patents on inventions which qualify under the parameters established in the context of the Government\u2019s economic and industrial policy; and \u2022 Integrate some Government Laboratories into the National Laboratory which shall eventually form part of the Biotechnology Park in San \u0120wann, with an investment of 20 million euro.", "Supporting small businesses and the self-employed Mr Speaker, Government is committed to continue protecting the interests of enterprises and the self-employed.", "These are the economic driving force of our country and contribute greatly towards wealth and job creation.", "Throughout the coming year, we shall take a number of initiatives to help this sector.", "In particular, we shall set up a fund of 10 million euro to give a micro-credit not exceeding 25,000 euro to small and medium-sized enterprises and the self-employed, with the aim of providing them with the necessary liquidity for investment.", "This credit shall not require the same collateral as requested by banks, and shall have advantageous interest rates.", "Furthermore, the European Investment Bank is ready to provide a further 10 million euro if the demand justifies this investment.", "We shall also give a number of fiscal benefits to motivate those enterprises to invest, expand and increase their efficiency.", "Amongst these: \u2022 we shall give a 40 percent tax credit, up to a maximum of 25,000 euro, to those self-employed persons and enterprises who employ up to a maximum of 10 persons, and sole traders, who shall make an investment in the coming two years, and who shall: o arrange their shop or facility; o invest in machinery, technology, apparatus or instruments which enhance their operations, including systems which help them save energy or to produce alternative energy; o make an investment in order to become compliant with health, safety, environment and physical access regulations; o create new jobs or recruit apprentices after the 10th November 2009; and o we shall increase the tax credit to 60 percent for those who carry out these investments in Gozo; and \u2022 we shall provide an incentive to those who incur expenses to increase workplace accessibility to new employees suffering from a disability.", "Mr Speaker, We shall set up a Fund of 200,000 euro to help the Trades and Crafts Enterprises to sustain this sector.", "There is also the need to expand awareness on enterprise and to invest in our entrepreneurial culture, by: \u2022 putting forward a Draft Law on Small Enterprises; \u2022 setting up a Consultative Council for the Enterprise as a dialogue forum between the Government, the regulatory authorities, and our business sectors.", "I take the opportunity to encourage Local Councils to set up a similar forum in their locality themselves; \u2022 enforcing, by means of legal amendments, the duty not to request enterprises to submit information which the Government already has elsewhere; \u2022 setting up, by not later than June of the coming year, a point of reference for the enterprise within Malta Enterprise to give assistance on European Union programmes; \u2022 further improving and simplifying the business licensing system; \u2022 devising, by not later than March of the coming year, a framework so that small and medium-sized businesses are given more support from the ETC, the Standards Authority and the Occupational Health and Safety Authority so that these improve their conformity with occupational health and safety rules; \u2022 launching a formal consultation process to establish which departments and public entities may require an adjustment in their opening hours to better meet business needs; and \u2022 we shall make it binding on departments and government entities to carry out independent research with the same enterprises, which research shall be published and shall show how and where the provided services impact the enterprises and how these can be improved.", "Incentives for tourism Mr Speaker, At this time last year we had forecasted that this was not going to be an easy period for our tourism sector due to the international crisis.", "We had always said that our country is under a bigger threat than other tourist destinations due to its dependence on air travel.", "The Government is aware of the fact that efforts must be made in order to attract tourists to come to Malta.", "For this reason, in the budget for the present year, not only had we increased MTA\u2019s funds by 3 million euro from the previous year, but throughout the year, we also pumped a further million for intensive marketing and advertising in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, France and the Netherlands.", "Ongoing advertising was also needed due to the late bookings phenomenon which is characterizing this industry.", "We have ensured that the accessibility of our country supports the industry, so much so that this summer we have retained the same seat capacity that we had in the previous year.", "New routes have been introduced from Bristol, Newcastle, Trapani, Edinburgh, Stockholm and Madrid.", "During this year, we have undertaken various different initiatives, as is shown in Appendix B which I am requesting the House to consider as read.", "The Government will keep on investing in this sector.", "For the coming year, we shall allocate 31 million euro to the Malta Tourism Authority to continue with its work in these difficult times, including a special package which provides an increase from 2 million euro to 5 million to address this crisis.", "We shall continue to enhance the accessibility towards our country and to invest in supporting various airlines.", "For the coming year we shall add new routes.", "We shall also enhance our advertising and marketing aggressively in our principal markets and we shall also consider new markets such as the Middle East.", "We shall also give a new look to the website visitmalta.com.", "Other than this, Government is allocating half a million euro to extend the scheme with sport organizations, as well as a similar scheme with the public sector to attract international conferences.", "The MTA shall also extend its assistance scheme to those hotels which increase their advertising from 2009 by financing half the additional expenditure.", "The VAT rate on restaurants Mr Speaker, for the past months we have been engaged in discussions on the economic and financial viability of reducing the VAT rate on restaurants from 18 to 5 percent.", "In agreement with MHRA, the Government commissioned a technical study on this proposal.", "I am tabling the results in the House.", "From this study, it results that, if this reduction in VAT is passed on in full on to the consumer, the economic growth in 2010 will be of 0.2 percent, and will increase to 0.6 percent in 2011.", "However, Government revenue decreases by 29 million euro in 2010 and by 23 million euro in 2011.", "The experience gained from other countries, where such a measure was taken, shows that such a reduction is not passed on to the consumer, and that its economic impact was relatively low.", "Above all, the study undertaken shows that, if this measure is taken, the tourist industry will not benefit much.", "For this reason, on the basis of all this evidence, Government believes that it should not take a measure that will be of little benefit for both the consumer and the economy, and which at the same time will lead to new taxes to make up for the loss of revenue.", "Schemes and initiatives for job creation Mr Speaker, Work is a source of personal wealth as well as wealth for the whole community.", "This Government has always considered work to be the basis of every economic and social progress.", "The challenges in this area are never-\n ending, especially during this period of great economic turmoil which is having a large impact on many countries.", "We are also being affected and it is inevitable that we keep on investing in this area.", "For this reason, I am going to announce a number of new measures which should help those who want to work and who are looking for employment.", "We are allocating 3.3 million euro, an increase of 1.3 million euro from this year, to the Employment and Training Corporation to launch a number of new initiatives, and amongst these we shall: \u2022 Launch a new scheme, known as the Work Trial Scheme, which seeks to integrate unemployed persons in a workplace for a period of 12 weeks so that these persons are able to receive additional work experiences.", "For 2010, ETC is aiming at to reach 500 persons; \u2022 Set up a new employment centre for youths in Birkirkara; \u2022 Provide a trial scheme to give work experience to the unemployed and to those wanting to enter the labour market; \u2022 Help with the payment of childcare to mothers who want to join training programs; \u2022 Enhance the advisory service to those seeking work; \u2022 Revise the disabled persons policy and register; \u2022 Provide personal assistance to disabled persons on the workplace; \u2022 Assist those who upgrade their workplaces in order to be employ severely disabled persons; \u2022 Extend the work scheme in the Community for those who are registered unemployed; \u2022 Launch a campaign to explain the benefits of declared work; and we shall \u2022 Invest in laboratory of mobile computers to be used outside the classroom.", "Mr Speaker, we believe that in this budget we should take another bold step in this sector.", "It is unacceptable for Malta to have youths between the ages of 16 and 20 who are not occupied, either working or training to further their skills by attending some educational institution or some other form of training.", "It is also unacceptable for Malta to have youths who are not doing anything despite the fact that they are capable of working if adequately trained.", "For this reason, we shall commit to a new and ambitious program of full-time training for those youths who are not working or being trained or in post-secondary education.", "Thanks to this program, these youths shall have the opportunity to gain a qualification recognized by the Malta Qualifications Council.", "This qualification is capable of being recognised in other European Union countries.", "This course will give further skills and formation to our youths, both in terms of work opportunities as well as for their personal enrichment.", "The youths who enrol in this project will also be given a stipend.", "To this end, we are allocating half a million euro.", "Other than this, we shall allocate a further 6.2 million euro from the European Social Fund to implement the extensive program of jobs for youths.", "Childcare services Mr Speaker, In order to increase employment, we need to have more facilities that support families with children during the time when the parents are at work.", "A year ago we had announced an increase in spending on child day care centres of 160,000 euro.", "This is because we believe that we need to carry on incentivizing more women to enter the workforce.", "Soon we will be opening two centres in primary schools, one in Si\u0121\u0121iewi and another one in Pembroke.", "We had also announced Government\u2019s intention to have at least one centre in each of our 10 colleges.", "We also opened the SmartKids centres in Cottonera, Birkirkara and Qawra with a specialized childcare service that also addresses the difficulties that are faced by certain families.", "It is Government\u2019s intention to open other such centres, including one in the Bormla primary school.", "Mr Speaker, we will be doubling this vote, with an increase of 300,000 euro in order to meet the demand for this service.", "In the last three years we provided around 500 childcare placements in a number of centres.", "During next year we will we establishing the national Child Care Unit, while investing in new centres in St Venera, Floriana, Msida and \u017bejtun.", "I would like to remind you also that, after the successful introduction of three pilot projects in schools, which are being kept open afterhours for those children whose parents need this service, we believe that this service can be extended slowly to other schools.", "For this reason, we will make the necessary investment so that two other schools can start offering this service as from next year.", "We will also be providing training to those offering childcare services in their homes, while they take care of the children of others.", "This training will conform with the standards issued by Government in 2006 and will be recognized by the Malta Qualifications Council.", "While we will carry on respecting these standards, we will also introduce a scheme where one-off financial and technical assistance will be given in order to ensure the right level of service.", "Mr Speaker, tax legislation already offers reductions to parents who send their children to childcare centres.", "As from next year an incentive will be given also to those employers who incur costs in order to create a working environment where child care services are provided for the employees\u2019 children.", "At present, the reduction of 1,000 euro is given only for children who are not more than three years of age, and who attend registered centres except during the summer months.", "This measure favouring the family will be extended further to also cover those children who are older than three years of age and who attend these centres during the summer months.", "Measures favouring fiscal morality and against tax evasion Mr Speaker, Government is clear about its policies favouring fiscal morality and against tax evasion, and therefore we will be intensifying our efforts in this regard.", "In this budget we are committing ourselves to increase Government\u2019s revenue by, as I have already announced through a number of initiatives and incentives, stimulating economic activity.", "But it is also necessary for us to improve the existing government enforcement, while introducing more measures to ensure that what is due to Government is paid.", "I am convinced, Mr Speaker, that if everyone had to pay what is due, this country would be able to survive with lower taxation levels than today\u2019s.", "We will intensify our fight against evasion, and against any form of contraband and other crimes that in some way or another have a negative effect on Government\u2019s revenue.", "For this reason: \u2022 we will start a process whereby the Inland Revenue Department, VAT Department and Department of Customs join forces so that, amongst other things, information gathered by fiscal entities can be used from the new entity\u2019s different sections.", "For this reason, whilst this amalgamation will improve the service given to the clients of these departments, these departments will be in a better position to enforce the fiscal laws in our country.", "This will also allow for the introduction of a system of set-offs in the financial system; \u2022 after our experience of this year in the VAT Department, where a number of companies were asking for refunds on paid VAT, while failing to fulfil their filing obligations for income tax purposes in order to avoid scrutiny, as from the 1st of June 2010, no refunds will be paid on VAT or income tax if the due returns under both systems are not sent.", "This will help identify those companies whose operations do not justify these refunds.", "While I understand that this can create difficulties for those companies who have for years not submitted their return, especially their income tax return, I urge these companies to grab the opportunity offered by the scheme which we announced a few weeks ago to regularize their position; and \u2022 in a time when tax revenue depending on economic activity is expected to decrease, different countries are introducing more specific provisions in their laws against abuse in order to protect their revenue.", "The introduction of the so-called anti-\n abuse provisions help to avoid tax leakage, and therefore help avoid placing more burdens on society in general.", "We will address, amongst other things, certain aggressive tax planning that has been noticed recently, and that is resulting in tax losses for the Government, whereby some are abusing of deficiencies or lack of clarity in fiscal laws.", "With the use of various provisions which will be introduced in the committee stage of the Draft Law on Budget Measures, we will decrease uncertainties in the application and interpretation of fiscal laws.", "Mr Speaker, we will continue strengthening our fight against contraband of diesel and the evasion of levy on it.", "For this reason, all fuel used in our country will be marked with a DNA marking and specific colours for the use of that fuel.", "The marking can only be bought from Customs.", "For this reason, Customs will be equipped with the appropriate apparatus to carry out tests on vehicles, petrol pumps, or storage places, and that can be carried out on the spot.", "Apart from this, we will introduce stricter penalties for those who are caught using or trafficking fuel illegally.", "These will include fines, sequestration and/or confiscation of craft and properties where the provision is found, as well as the suspension or withdrawal of licences in the case of licensed operators in this sector.", "We will intensify our fight against every type of contraband, including that of cigarettes and alcohol.", "For this reason, we are increasing the penalties for this abuse as is shown in the respective law amendments that are being put forward.", "Yet, on the other hand, Mr Speaker, in order for us to have a tax system built on reciprocal trust between the departments administering it, all the taxpayers and stakeholders, there is a need for the tax departments to be transparent and accountable for their behaviour towards the public.", "They need to be professional and fair, they must make it easier and cheaper for the public to fulfil its obligations, give reliable information, and be firm with those who try to evade tax.", "For this reason, as from next year, a Taxpayer\u2019s Charter will be developed that will help the public understand its rights as a taxpayer, the service and level of service that should be expected from the departments, as well as tax obligation.", "This Charter is not meant to replace the legal protection that the law offers its taxpayers, like confidentiality, data protection, and various other rights.", "Exploiting our resources better to safeguard against similar crisis in the future Mr Speaker, for a long time, Government property was considered a resource the only scope of which was its sale and that Government would use this income to finance its annual needs.", "Government believes that Government property should be used better as a form of long term investment with annual returns.", "As another important step to provide the public with a better service, and for Government to be more effective and efficient, we will invest in a new technology system.", "This system will allow an increase in quality and better efficiency.", "We need a system that does not depend on 80,000 files containing all the information about Government property.", "This electronic system will bring about a thorough reform which will positively effect the Government Property Division.", "On the other hand, in this budget we are allocating 10 million euro to accelerate payments for expropriations which took place before 1994, as well as to resolve old cases of possession and use by successive socialist governments that took over land for housing reasons and never paid any compensation to the owners concerned.", "National Investment Fund Mr Speaker, Government decided to establish the National Investment Fund to serve as a means of long-\n term investment for our country.", "This Fund aims to create new sources of revenue for Government in order to decrease Government\u2019s dependence on direct and indirect tax revenue from our people.", "This Fund will be an institution that is directed on purely commercial lines from a team of professional people.", "The Fund will have a committee to draft the fund\u2019s investment policy and its financial aims.", "The intention is for the Fund to work in three main areas: 1.", "the management and direction of Government commercial property with the aim of maximizing the State\u2019s revenue from this property; 2.", "to hold investments in stocks and shares, both local and foreign, and with no controlling interest; and 3.", "to invest in national projects or projects of a strategic nature for the country, like the ones connected to the regeneration of Valletta.", "More competitive markets and price stability Inflation control Mr Speaker, in the last two-and-a-half years the world has experienced huge economic and financial turmoil.", "We have seen extraordinary movements in prices, especially in the prices of many essential products.", "We have seen an explosion of prices of cereals, and great volatility in oil prices.", "With an open economy dependent on the importation of the majority of its needs, these international price trends have affected us critically and increased local inflation considerably.", "Mr Speaker, we are committed towards doing all that is possible, and that makes sense in the context of a free and competitive market, to keep the inflation in our country under control.", "This is necessary to safeguard our monetary value, and therefore, our standard of living, as well as work that depends a lot on the international competitiveness of our country.", "All this is threatened when the price levels in our country increase in an unjustified manner and contrary to the basic rules of a free and competitive market.", "Government is working to remove any inflexibility that may exist in our markets and that may contribute to further increases in prices.", "For this reason we are reforming the Consumer and Competition Division, and establishing the Maltese Fair Trade Authority, as promised in our electoral programme.", "We will also create an entity for consumer protection.", "This entity will play an important role in education and consumer protection, and will launch thrust schemes between the consumer and the seller.", "It will also strengthen the Price Watch mechanism.", "Another area which is of concern to Government is that of medicine.", "The voluntary mechanism which we had launched with the sector did not have the results we hoped for.", "Therefore, a more efficient and effective mechanism on the prices of medicine will be introduced.", "While the price surveys will still be carried out on the principles agreed upon during the establishment of this committee, the mechanism will change into a mandatory one unless an alternative system is introduced.", "We are also looking closely at the operations of the vegetable marketing centre \u2013 a sensitive sector because of the farmers\u2019 dependency on the present structure.", "It is a fact that the prices of fruit and vegetables are not responding to international trends because of different practices that are neither in the farmers\u2019 best interests nor in that of the consumer\u2019s.", "Mr Speaker, we will carry on preparing a report by the Ministry of Finance about the causes and trends in prices of importation, exportation, assets, and retail products and services, and about how these are affecting consumers and firms.", "This report will carry on being published and submitted to social partners for discussion within the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development.", "We will be establishing as well a College of Regulators with the scope of serving as a coordination forum for all Entities whose function is somehow connected to our market.", "This College will be made up of all the regulators in our country, and MCESD representatives.", "Every regulator will be asked to inform and discuss with this College all that is happening and the actions that he would be taking in his field, and that would be somehow influencing firms, workers and consumers.", "Energy Prices Mr Speaker, Malta is totally dependent on oil to generate electricity and filter seawater.", "The international oil price is still very unstable and increasing.", "Mr Speaker, We are obliged to pay for the increases in the price of oil in order to buy the oil that we need.", "The expenditure we incur can only be collected in two ways: either from the rates paid by everyone, or by way of subsidies collected from taxes.", "Government has always used these two methods \u2013 subsidies and rates \u2013 and it is our intention to carry on doing this.", "It is an illusion to believe that water and electricity rates will not increase when the price for oil from abroad increases, or that they will not decrease when the price for oil decreases.", "It is true that for many years we did not change our rates because we used to increase or decrease the subsidy, but this was only possible until oil was only 20 or 30 dollars a barrel, and not at today\u2019s prices! Assistance to families Mr Speaker, Government is conscious of the fact that the higher international price of oil, which led to increases in water and electricity rates, placed a burden on our families.", "These rates affected inflation and therefore resulted in an increase of the cost of living adjustment that we are giving in this budget.", "Since the price of oil has increased again, water and electricity rates will be adjusted again as from 1st January of next year.", "EneMalta\u2019s proposal, for this reason, is being assessed by the Malta Resources Authority.", "But, at this stage and before the new rates are approved, Government feels the need to safeguard for these increases by drafting direct financial assistance for our families so that, as much as possible, a large number of families will not see increases in their bills when compared to those of today.", "Others will not see large increases.", "Whilst providing this aid, Government has decided to help families that do not consume more than 10,000 units of electricity.", "Therefore, nearly 97 percent of all families in the country will receive aid from Government.", "The compensation which we will give will be: Table 3.1 Compensation to families Family size Compensation (euro) 1 55 2 80 3 105 4 130 5 155 6 180 7 205 This aid will cost Government 10 million euro.", "Apart from this, the Energy Benefit will be adjusted to help 28,000 families, the aid for whom will cost Government 7 million euro.", "I would like to remind you that Government has established the Reserve Fund as Aid to Enterprise of 2.5 million euro for entities that may face difficulties.", "A direct subsidy of 14.6 million euro will also be given to the Water Services Corporation to use for sewage-related operations.", "Investing in the country\u2019s infrastructure to sustain economic growth Mr Speaker, This year\u2019s budget presents capital investment spendings of about 430 million euro, some 180 million of which will be coming from European Union funds.", "We believe the impact of this investment in 2010 should help the country out of the recession.", "New arterial and residential roads Mr Speaker, next year\u2019s investment in our roads will reach 43.7 million euro, which includes both the construction programme of arterial roads and others in various localities.", "The road to Marsascala will be completed, whereas Valletta Road extending to Zurrieq will be constructed as well as the road which from Zabbar leads to the vicinities of SmartCity.", "The road to Marfa, the road in Marsa leading to the Menqa and the cargo terminal, M\u0121arr Road in Gozo and European Council Road between Marsa and Luqa will also be improved.", "During the course of the coming year we shall also invest a further 14 million euro on the maintenance and reconstruction of many roads in various towns and villages, in order to improve their quality and our safety.", "With regard to road construction and maintenance we believe there is scope for the active participation of the private sector.", "For this reason: \u2022 we shall be working, with the cooperation of the Local Councils, in issuing a number of calls for tenders for the construction of a number of roads in villages and towns through public private partnerships, which the contractor undertaking the work would be obliged to construct and maintain for a number of years, and who would be paid for them in the period in which he would be responsible.", "Government is allocating one million euro every year under the Local Council Special Funds, and those deciding to participate are to fund half of the expenditure.", "The fund reserved for this scheme will amount to two million euro.", "This project is estimated to cost eight million euro; \u2022 work will also be commenced so that a call for tenders will be issued for the reconstruction of various roads in Gozo on the same model, which project is estimated to cost about four million euro.", "This means that expenditure on road infrastructure in 2010 could reach up to 53.7 million euro.", "Transport Public transport reform Mr Speaker, We believe we should address our public transport system.", "This is necessary if we have to mitigate the excessive dependency on private cars and the environmental damage it is causing.", "We are not very aware of the negative economic effect produced by an inefficient transport system.", "Economic operators stuck in traffic jams and congestions, and searching for a parking space, waste too much time and fuel, and all this will decrease productivity.", "By means of the reform, Government believes that we could be offering a viable option to private cars, without impinging on the prices which consumers are paying today.", "Although initially Government will be liable to keep on granting some sort of subsidy to the new operator, the system cannot survive on the principle that the more passengers turned away by the system the more it is subsidized.", "The subsidy must be accompanied by the profit motive in order that the operator could encourage more people to make use of public transport.", "Commercial viability, and thus the eventual subsidy withdrawal, comes along when we manage to entice more people to leave their cars behind and make use of route buses.", "The new Authority which will be responsible for transport will invest nine million euro on new bus terminals in Valletta, Rabat Gozo, and Bu\u0121ibba\u2019s tourist centre.", "In addition, about 10 other localities will be improved around Malta wherein a large number of route services will be concentrated.", "Blata l-Bajda\u2019s Park and Ride will be extended and two new others will be developed, one in Marsa and the other in Pembroke.", "Commercial vehicle registration tax reform Mr Speaker, after the reform we carried out last year in the light vehicle sector, we are now in position to propose a reform in the registration tax and licensing of the commercial vehicle sector.", "This reform is intended to reward whoever pollutes the least.", "The registration tax will take into consideration the vehicle euro-standard.", "For these types of vehicles this is the benchmark applied by the European Union regarding emissions.", "The new system will promote Euro 5 and 4 commercial vehicles which are regarded as the least polluting.", "Vehicles of such standard will attract no registration tax.", "On the other hand, on Euro 3 and lower-standard vehicles, a registration tax will be levied related to weight not to value.", "There could be instances where the registration tax on vehicles of this category marketed by importers, would be allowed a two-year transition period during which vehicles will keep on being sold under the former regime.", "Licences under the new system will also take the euro-\n standard into consideration.", "Those in the Euro 4 and 5 categories will be reduced in the first nine years, whereas those of a lower standard will increase.", "In order that the effect of this change is mitigated, for all those commercial vehicles already registered by the end of this year we shall allow four years before the new licence rates become effective.", "This should be a good opportunity for business owners who will be given a chance to renew their heavy vehicles.", "Mr Speaker, together with this speech, we are publishing our proposal on this sector in Appendix C, which I request the House to consider as read.", "Port regeneration Mr Speaker, We kept on progressing with our vision\u2019s implementation programme for Valletta\u2019s ports.", "This year we inaugurated the new cruise liner quay along Vittoriosa\u2019s coastline.", "Moreover, Government set about publishing Menqa\u2019s development programme details, for the enlargement of yacht berthing space in the ports, as well as quay improvement and repairs.", "In addition to this, initiatives have been taken to improve the mobility through the port\u2019s breakwater and lift connection between the Port and Upper Barrakka.", "With these I must also make mention of Fort St Elmo\u2019s restoration in connection to which the Grand Harbour Regeneration Corporation filed five applications with MEPA for its restoration.", "Government is also allocating 1.5 million euro for emergency repairs on Fort St Angelo.", "In order that our ports could fulfil their function, in the coming year Government will spend 10 million euro on dredging works in our country\u2019s main ports.", "The construction and embellishment of public places Mr Speaker, our country\u2019s overall appearance is a major contributor to the country\u2019s better competitiveness Mr Speaker, In this budget we are announcing a financial allocation of 5.2 million euro for embellishment projects in various areas around Malta, including the projects of St George\u2019s Square in Valletta, St George\u2019s Bay promenade, the National Park at the Salini, and the fourth enlargement of the National Park at Ta\u2019 Qali.", "In the coming weeks, we shall start implementing a number of investment projects of about 80 million euro, which include the restoration of the bastions, the embellishment of, and the amenities along, the Sliema and Qawra coastlines, a new promenade in St Paul\u2019s Bay, a garden and heritage trail in Pembroke, and a visitor attraction in Qawra.", "With particular emphasis on the regular maintenance of projects and infrastructure 1.3 million euro are being budgeted to be administered by the Environment Upgrade Committee with inter-ministerial representation and other stakeholders, and managed by the Office of the Prime Minister.", "Investing in our historic and cultural heritage Government will remain committed in investing in our historic and cultural heritage.", "Therefore, for the coming year, we are budgeting 9.7 million euro for these projects, in order that among other things, we will carry on with the restoration of Auberge de Castille, the Presidential Palace, the area known as the Collacchio in Vittoriosa, and that of the Wignacourt fountain in Saqqajja Hill.", "The City of Valletta Last June we announced the projects of our country\u2019s Capital City entrance: City Gate, the theatre and the new Parliament.", "Time is ripe for the Maltese Parliament, like any other parliament worldwide to have a home appropriate to the dignity of all citizens\u2019 freedoms.", "This isn\u2019t a building for the Members of Parliament.", "Parliament is an expression and the monument recognizing the Maltese and Gozitan peoples as a sovereign and democratic nation.", "In addition to this, there is work to be carried out in order to ensure that the Palace could once again become Valletta\u2019s focal point and main jewel in the crown.", "As announced earlier in this speech, the funding of this project will be administered from the National Investment Fund, which fund will be builg up from commercial rents and the introduction of concessions.", "For this Fund, the project will be regarded as an investment which will be leased to the Maltese State from the utilization of the project over a number of years.", "This means that this project\u2019s funding will not be a burden on the taxes of the people of Malta and Gozo.", "Several projects are also under way all over Valletta, including the paving of the pedestrian area of central Valletta, the development of a historic park in the space below and around the Barrakka by the Heritage Malta Foundation, and the development of a new elevator at Upper Barrakka.", "Investment within the energy sector Mr Speaker, Next year we shall commence works on the extension of Delimara\u2019s power station which will make use of contemporaneous technology so that in a few years it will replace the outdated and polluting technology we have at Marsa.", "Rather than emitting them in the air through chimneys, the polluting materials will be pre-captured and exported in a safe manner for licensed deposits of these materials abroad.", "Work will be commenced so that we could connect to the European power grid, allowing us to combine our required energy sources between that generated locally and that imported.", "Thus we could strike a better balance between the price and the environmental impact of the energy we buy.", "Wastewater Mr Speaker, in 2010, with an investment of 30 million euro, we shall close the investment cycle we launched five years ago regarding wastewater.", "In another year\u2019s time we would be treating all the wastewater generated in our country before it flows into the sea.", "Now, the next step is to see how wastewater, given that it has been treated, could be changed into a resource we could exploit to our benefit.", "Presently we are carrying out tests to see how we could make use of the treated water, and mitigate the need for its extraction from the water table and reverse

for its contribution to our economy.", "It is a sector which can give an even bigger contribution.", "During 2009, this sector slowed down because of the impact of the international financial crisis.", "In November 2006, we had carried out an important change in the taxation on the transfer of property when we introduced a final withholding tax of 12 per cent on the market value of the property in question.", "With those changes, we had given the choice between the old system, that is with the normal rates on capital gains when the property in question is transferred within five years from the date of purchase.", "After several proposals to Government, and having studied the current market situation, for the years 2010 and 2011 we shall be extending the period of choice from

secondary schools in Mosta and in Gozo are being built, with an investment of 7 million euro for each school.", "Embellishment works in more than 60 Government schools have been carried out, in which a new IT infrastructure is being built and sports facilities are being improved.", "In the national consultation on the transition from the primary to the secondary school we have held discussions with Church schools regarding the implementation of the principles of this reform.", "In order to ensure that students can benefit from a process of continuity between the primary and the secondary schools it is important that some Church schools extend the primary or secondary school levels.", "Government will therefore increase the financial allocation to these new classes in accordance with the agreement between the Church and the State on Church schools, and will also refund 15.2 per cent of the qualifying expenses related to new constructions needed in these Church schools in the implementation of the reform regarding the transition from primary to secondary school.", "The e-learning strategy However, Mr Speaker, the construction of new schools alone is not enough.", "As we had announced in last year\u2019s budget, we shall be investing 16 million euro over a number of years in a system of networking between schools.", "This will allow us to have schools equipped with

work in this field is described in Appendix D, which I ask the House to consider as read.", "Youth A lot of work is being carried out in the youth sector because we believe that they have an essential and determining role in our country\u2019s politics.", "In particular, we are updating the National Youth Policy, which will be published in the coming weeks.", "We have seen the need to inform youths and their associations about the benefits of European Union programmes, with the result that more youths are participating in these programmes.", "We have also strengthened the Youth Local Council

localities in which more than 4,500 persons, from children to elderly people have participated.", "The Government will continue to work to support all this, and therefore we shall increase sporting

their facilities; and \u2022 we shall be strengthening the sports tourism scheme to incentivize more the holding of international sporting activities in Malta and Gozo.", "The Creative Economy Mr Speaker, creativity is the engine of the global economy.", "Those countries capable of developing and supporting an environment where the creative talent of the population is brought forth and prospers are the countries most capable to support their economic and social development.", "The creative areas of the economy, which include ICT, films, arts and design, as well as performing arts and others, create a lot of high value-\n added work, support other sectors within the economy, like tourism, manufacturing and other sectors, and at the same time create a vibrant and innovative environment in those contexts where these sectors develop.", "Thus, even the people's quality of life improves.", "We will therefore continue to incentivize this sector consistently with the Vision 2015 to make our country a centre of excellence in various sectors, including that of creativity.", "In this context, we propose the following initiatives: 1.", "We will create a working group to draft the regulatory and fiscal organizational framework for the promotion of the creative economy; 2.", "We will introduce a number of fiscal incentives for this sector, including: \u2022 fiscal benefits for qualifying costs to make it easier for eligible Maltese authors to publish their literary works; \u2022 tax credits to cover qualifying costs spent on computer animation, special effects,

Arts Studies programme.", "These scholarships are being dedicated to visual arts which include studies in paintings, sculpture, media, and design, amongst others, and also performing arts such as music, dance and drama.", "Through this scheme, students wishing to specialize in arts have the opportunity to apply for scholarships in programmes recognized locally and abroad.", "This initiative, in which we are investing 200,000 euro per year, will provide the opportunity for each individual to continue developing and cultivating his talents.", "Investment in cultural sectors With regard to the cultural sector, we have taken various initiatives in the past years because we believe this should be appreciated more within our country.", "Therefore, Mr Speaker, with this budget we will continue to support the culture and we are increasing the allocation to different of Cultural Entities by more than 800,000 euro in order to improve their sustainability.", "We are increasing the allocation to the National Orchestra, to the Manoel Theatre, to the Centre for Creativity, and to the Foundation of Arts.", "Furthermore, we are allocating 100,000 euro for the purchase of new books

continue to show more appreciation of our artists.", "Stronger investment and continued support to the needy in society Mr Speaker, This Government undertakes, notwithstanding all financial difficulties, to maintain and develop a system of social security that evaluates who is the most in need in order to have a fair society.", "At the same time we are increasing our fight against waste and deceit.", "One must appreciate, Mr Speaker, that in this area, in terms of recurrent expenditure only, the sum of more than 1.19 billion euro is being allocated, an increase of more than 8.5 per cent over 2009, and 48 per cent of the Government\u2019s total recurrent expenditure.", "The main expenditure is in pensions and social security that, from 749 million euro will increase by 62 million euro, an increase of 8 per cent, to 811 million.", "Continued assistance to those most in need Investment in families Mr Speaker, The family is the fulcrum of society, and we therefore believe that we should do everything possible to sustain and strengthen our families.", "For this reason, we require that the family perspective, as well as the economic and social impact on the family, is integrated as part of the planning and implementation process of Government policy.", "This process will be administered by the Integrated Policy Section which is being set up by the Office of the Prime Minister as part of the MEPA reform.", "Investing in the protection of children At the moment in our country we have about 400 children being brought up outside the nuclei of their natural family, and who are found in residential homes and with foster families.", "As from the coming year, the Child in Care Benefit will increase from \u20ac40 per week to \u20ac70 per week, and the age for assistance will increase up to 21 years for those youths who are still studying or are following a training programme approved by the ETC.", "Assisting single mothers Mr Speaker, our country shows solidarity with those who continuously require it.", "This is what we believe should be done, and we will continue to do so.", "We will continue assisting our families and those parents who are bringing up their children alone, with all possible means.", "However, we believe we should assist them, also, to keep themselves active in the area of training and work, so that they can be better integrated in society, while they will be in a better position to improve their way of life over and above dependency.", "For this purpose, with the help of ETC and other Entities, we envisage that these persons will be receiving all the training and assistance required so that they too will be integrated in the work market as quickly as possible.", "For this purpose, one of the ETC schemes will also offer assistance in childcare costs to those who undergo this training.", "Recognition of alimony established by foreign courts Through this budget the Government also wishes to remedy the somewhat anomalous situation in the income tax law, when it comes to exempting a person who receives child alimony from the other spouse.", "Up to now a person paying alimony to the other spouse, not related to children, is given income tax deductions when the payment has been established by the Maltese Courts.", "As from next year, the exemption and deduction will also be given when the alimony has been established by foreign courts, on condition that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue approves.", "Persons with disability As regards persons with disability, the National Commission for Persons with

assist families with children, disabled persons and the elderly amongst others.", "The cost for next year is expected to reach 6.7 million euro.", "Measures to reduce abuse As I mentioned earlier, it is the Government's duty that, while ensuring that whoever requires our support gets it, at the same time we are to continue to step up our fight against those who abuse of social benefits.", "Therefore, to strengthen all the functions of investigation, in the course of the coming year the various sections of inspectorate under the Ministry of Social Policy will be integrated with the aim of having a more effective structure to combat those who are abusing.", "Mechanism for single means testing In this context, the Government is undertaking to revise the process for persons to qualify for services and social benefits so that this is easier and more transparent, while ensuring it is not abused.", "Therefore, as from next year, a full reform in the single means testing will be

and one to which the Government has always given top priority is that of our health.", "The Government is committed to place Malta as a regional centre of excellence in the medical sector by 2015 by

is possible.", "In these times of global recession, when innovative solutions are required, the Government\u2019s strategic objectives are to increase access, promote quality, and to offer sustainable services.", "Expenditure to address waiting lists Mr Speaker, we believe it is our duty to remain committed to reach the population\u2019s expectations in the health sector, whether current or future.", "These expectations are always increasing because of an ageing population, and are resulting in an increase in the pressure on waiting lists.", "Consequently, the Government is committed to give absolute priority to reductions in waiting lists to acceptable levels in three years.", "We have already started working to achieve this objective.", "Now we are allocating a further 4 million euro to address waiting lists.", "Medicine In the medicine sector, we are preparing the necessary mechanism so that decisions for the introduction of new medicines and new technologies are based on relative evidence and efficiency.", "We have introduced the PET scanner service, while other innovative technologies and cardiac imaging are being evaluated and considered.", "For the coming year, we

the reform in primary care will be one of the most important challenges for next year.", "We are launching a document for public consultation in the next few days to provide scope for national

to reach in the next five years, amongst them the construction of a cancer centre at Mater Dei hospital.", "We are refurbishing Boffa hospital to ensure that patients receive high level of treatment and in a comfortable environment and at a good level.", "We have also opened a centre for breast screening to treat breast cancer in women before it\u2019s too late.", "All that I have mentioned, Mr Speaker, cannot be achieved without the presence of workers trained in their professions and with vast experience in their subjects.", "Therefore, to continue training our workers, we are allocating 1.6 million euro for various training schemes for all the workers.", "Mental health We also firmly believe that persons with problems of mental health problems should be better integrated in the community and we have therefore created the Learning Disability Training Unit, intended to accept these people who will start being given training and assistance to prepare themselves for their return to life within the community.", "Mr Speaker, up till today, suicide cases or suicide attempts were handled by the police.", "The Government believes that it should create a Crisis Intervention Service so that these persons can be treated by specially trained professionals.", "Maintenance at Karen Grech Hospital The infrastructure at Karen Grech Hospital is being changed until the construction of a rehabilitation centre with all the amenities required for persons recovering from illnesses or serious treatment.", "The services provided at \u017bammit Clapp Hospital will be transferred to Karen

for 2010.", "Care of the elderly Full increase for pensioners Mr.", "Speaker, the elderly and pensioners are also important on this Government\u2019s agenda.", "As we did in the past two budgets, for the coming year we are guaranteeing that around eighty thousand pensioners will be given the full cost of living increase.", "Residences for our elderly Mr Speaker, During the year, we completed the

Speaker, we must invest in community services, and therefore we have embarked on a pilot project to continue expanding this service during the coming year.", "The services provided by Commcare will be consolidated, while new day centres are planned to open in Mellie\u0127a and Si\u0121\u0121iewi.", "We have also launched a pilot project for Night Shelters in the Jesus of Nazareth Institute, \u017bejtun.", "The aim of this project is to offer accommodation during the night to those elderly who live alone.", "We are also going to begin a new pilot project, Outreach Team, through which a group of professionals from several disciplines will provide support to the elderly so that, where possible, these will remain living in the community.", "For this pilot project we are allocating 600,000 euro.", "Caring for our environment A sustainable future for our children Mr.", "Speaker, our country, like the rest of the world, is increasingly facing environmental challenges, not least through the phenomenon of climate change.", "We have aims and obligations to reach by 2020, among them that 10 per cent of our energy must come from clean sources by using alternative energy technologies from the sun or from the wind or other clean energy.", "We have already announced a number of initiatives for our country to generate clean energy from the wind.", "Now we are allocating 300,000 euro for the necessary environmental impact studies to be able to begin.", "Energy from alternative sources Mr Speaker, thanks to the investment we made in the sector of waste management, today we are in a position to discuss technologies and facilities which give us energy from waste.", "For the coming year, we are allocating 16 million euro for waste management.", "I would like to point out that, in the coming weeks and months, we will see the commissioning of the mechanised treatment plant and the digesters in the Sant\u2019Antnin waste recycling plant at Marsascala.", "Mr.", "Speaker, Government is again allocating a substantial amount to continue fostering a culture in favour of equipment which generates energy from the sun.", "Therefore, we will introduce a scheme offering grants on photovoltaic systems with an allocation of 3.8 million euro, and on solar water heaters with an allocation of 4.2 million.", "The photovoltaic systems scheme will be open to everyone and eligible applicants will receive a grant of up to 50 per cent of their capital expenditure up to a maximum of 3,000 euro.", "The solar water heaters scheme will be limited to: \u2022 families entitled to the energy benefit; \u2022 those who receive supplementary assistance; \u2022 families entitled to fixed children\u2019s allowance, namely when their income is less than 23,923

the solar water heater systems, around 2,500 families a year will benefit, while in the case of the photovoltaic systems, around 400 families a year will benefit.", "I must also add that this project also includes an educational campaign about clean energy costing half a million euro.", "Government is also drawing up a call for tenders for those interested in installing and operating systems which generate electricity through photovoltaic panels.", "For this purpose, we will allocate public spaces which have been considered appropriate for use by these systems.", "One of the criteria in this tender will be the price which the developer will ask for the electricity to be generated.", "In this way, Government will be introducing the feed-in-\n tariff principle.", "Developments in the administration of the eco-\n contribution Since the introduction of the eco-contribution, in 2004, Government transferred the income from this contribution directly into waste management.", "Substantial progress was registered in this sector due to the massive investment undertaken.", "Notwithstanding the efforts made and which still have to be made, Government is committed to honour another pledge, after a process of preparation and consultation, by implementing certain adjustments in the administration of this law.", "Government is prepared to give refunds, or even exempt from paying eco-\n contributions, those producers who are bearing part of our country\u2019s national obligation, where packaging waste is concerned.", "In this context, there are two main principles which I must emphasise: 1.", "Government\u2019s wish is that, although the producer will be bound by certain new functions, the consumer must in no way be negatively affected; and 2.", "that the producer\u2019s business expenses should not increase as a result of his fulfilling his environmental obligations.", "Therefore, Government will introduce a pilot concept with regard to the administration of the eco-contributions, which can then be distributed among bigger producers, with the aim of recognising through concrete facts the contribution which the producers are giving and are going to have to give in carrying out their environmental duties.", "This very week, we will publish three drafts of legal notices for final consultation with the aim, within parameters which will

that do not lose any opportunity to instil doubts and discouragement in a moment when there is a need for hope and unity between us.", "But Government faces this storm with all the Maltese people, with its social partners, with everyone who has not given up hope and remained hopeful in our country\u2019s capability.", "Mr Speaker, This budget proposes to the House: \u2022 To invest 80 million

in the name of Government and the Maltese people, goes to the trade unions, to employers, to civil society, and to all our families for your huge contribution during the past year.", "Thank you to all those that during next year will collaborate with Government so that thanks to this budget we will change the challenges that we will face into opportunities for all our people.", "We believe in our people.", "Yes, we believe that together we can overcome the storm and emerge stronger.", "In this budget we have made choices for next year.", "We sought to make these choices responsibly.", "We are investing to generate more jobs.", "We are investing in education, in health, in training, in the social sector and in Gozo.", "This is a budget by means of which we want to create more work.", "We
