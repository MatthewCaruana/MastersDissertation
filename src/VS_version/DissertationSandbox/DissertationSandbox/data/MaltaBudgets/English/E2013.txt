Preamble 
 
 
Mr  Speaker, 
 
 
This  evening I am presenting  the first budget of this Legislature. It is being 
presented by a new Government about four months after it was supposed 
to have been approved by Parliament. Today we shall be doing what the 
previous Government should have put in place itself had it acted prudently. 
 
 
This evening we will not waste time arguing about the past and about who 
was to blame for this impasse. 
The people spoke clearly on the 9th of March and pronounced its judgement. 
My duty and the duty of the new Government is to act competently and to see 
that the public finances are managed in the best possible way. Because the 
people have a right to expect good judgement and discretion from the 
Government it elected. 
 
 
Whilst still in Opposition, out of prudence and with a sense of responsibility 
towards the country, this Government had promised to keep to the framework 
of this Budget even because it was understood that this Budget had been 
agreed with the European Commission.  This decision was taken within the 
reality of an unapproved Budget to maintain and strengthen certainty and 
stability in the country. Our families and businesses needed to be assured that 
what had been promised in Budget 2013 would be given to them irrespective 
of who was in Government. 
 
 
There were those who criticised this decision.  Some saw a contradiction 
in our position as a new Government, elected on the call for a change in 
direction, in keeping the framework of a Budget presented by the previous 
Government. However, as we had then explained, a change in direction 
2 
 
comes through the performance of the Government, through the way things 
are done and through the will to act with prudence, discretion and diligence. 
 
 
Another reason is that, in this same week that this Budget is being presented, 
the European Commission is expecting from us the framework of another 
Budget – for the year 2014. This will be a Budget that will better and 
more clearly reflect the proposals that make up the Road Map of this new 
Government. A programme of work which the people chose and for the 
implementation of which we were given a solid mandate. Today we want our 
economy to run smoothly and not stall in the needless uncertainty brought 
about by further waiting for some new Budget. 
 
 
There was agreement by both sides of the House not to change anything of 
what was presented last November save for the introduction of a measure 
through which those whose only income is the minimum wage should not be 
liable to income tax. 
 
 
We could have limited ourselves to this. However, faced by the reality of the 
situation and because we are responsible, we had to face various challenges 
and take the necessary decisions. 
 
 
The first challenge my Ministry had to face was to decide which version of 
the 2013 Budget to adopt. We had three versions that were incompatible 
with each other - the one read by the Minister who preceded me, the one 
found in the estimates he presented, and the one that was incorporated in 
the Bills prepared for implementation once the Budget was approved.  The 
discrepancies between these three versions were not insignificant. We shall 
amplify on this later on. 
 
 
The second challenge was posed by the financial performance both during 
last year and also in the first three months of this year. During this period 
the income and expenditure of the Government took an undesired turn. This 
3 
 
results from the Government accounts as reported by the National Office of 
Statistics. 
 
 
Government’s Financial Situation 
 
 
The Nationalist Government’s original goal was to end the year 2012 with a 
deficit in the Consolidated Fund of €145 million.  However this target was 
not reached. The deficit more than doubled at €342 million.  This reality 
was continually refuted by the previous Government to the extent that in 
November, only one month prior to the closure of the books, they still insisted 
that the revised deficit would only amount to €180 million. 
 
 
The increase in the deficit was primarily the result of income projections that 
were far too optimistic and which, as we had pointed out, could not be realised. 
In fact, at the end of 2012, Government revenue was €245 million lower 
than that approved.  There was a shortfall of around €150 million in revenue 
from excise duty, VAT, National Insurance contributions as well as from 
licences and other taxes.  It is true that this shortfall includes around €66 
million in excise duty due to Government by Enemalta Corporation.  It also 
includes a drop in European Union Funds of around €100 million that 
were then balanced out in the capital expenditure account through the system 
of accruals. 
 
 
The fact remains, however, that the shortfall in Government revenue was 
significant. 
 
 
It is evident that in order to offset the d e c r e a s e  in income from 
Enemalta Corporation, the Nationalist Government planned to raise water 
and electricity rates once again after the elections.
4 
 
This Government will not do this. On the contrary, we have started working 
on a plan that will lead to cheaper utility bills whilst strengthening the 
sustainability of Enemalta Corporation. 
 
 
As regards expenditure, the level of spending was higher than that approved. 
There was a net over-expenditure of around €26 million by the various 
Ministries, mainly the Health and Social Security Ministries and €21 million 
in new payments to Enemalta Corporation. 
 
 
The Government’s revenue and expenditure for the year 2012 as compared to 
those of the previous year are illustrated in Table No.1 
 
 
On the basis of the Consolidated Fund this deficit amounts to 5.1 per cent. 
However, this is not the figure that represents the realistic fiscal deficit of  
the country. 
 
 
The aforementioned extraordinary transfers and changes bring down the 
deficit when measured on the basis of General Government through the 
accruals system of accounts.  Even so however, the deficit is far in excess of 
what was planned in the Budget for the year 2012. In a nutshell, we ended 
the year 2012 with a General Government deficit of 3.3 per cent. 
 
 
Technically this could force us back into the procedure known as the Excessive 
Deficit Procedure (EDP). 
 
 
However this is moot and on this point one has to await further 
developments. 
 
 
Let us state things plainly.  These results come as no surprise to anyone, 
least of all to us who last year sat on the other side of the House. At the time 
we had warned the Government on several occasions that the direction it 
5 
 
had taken and the instability it had brought about were having an adverse 
effect on the economic activity in the country, particularly consumption and 
investment, and would lead to  failure in meeting the fiscal targets. 
 
 
They started off with unrealistic projections, they ignored the Commission’s 
warnings not once but three times and fell into the Excessive Deficit 
Procedure they had vowed to avoid. Every time we remarked that the deficit 
was growing, we were told to be patient, to wait and see. 
 
 
Now we have waited, we have seen and we have been proved right.

Estimates for 2013 
 
 
Mr Speaker, 
 
 
I have also asked the public officers to give me a financial account for the first 
three months of this year. The reason was to be in a position to present more 
realistic estimates for 2013 in the light of the current circumstances. I wish 
to report that, for reasons that will be explained shortly, the revised Budget 
estimates envisage an increase of around €68 million in the Consolidated Fund 
deficit. I table the details outlining our estimates regarding this increase. 
 
 
The details of the revised estimates for the year 2013 regarding revenue from 
taxation, recurrent expenditure, capital investment and Government debt are 
indicated in Tables 2 and 3, which I hereby request the House to consider as 
read.

The fiscal slippage experienced in the past months will not dishearten us, 
nor will we use it as an excuse to go back on what we promised. We merely 
wanted to set the records straight and know exactly where we stand. 
 
 
I wish to emphasise that we will fulfil all our proposals. As I shall shortly 
explain, the change in direction is intended to make such fiscal slippage 
part of Malta’s past history. Our people are tired of the lack of transparency 
that shrouds Government estimates. They want to know the truth. They 
want fiscal estimates that are realistic. They want a clear plan of how the 
desired economic growth of the country will come about. They want to be sure 
that the national debt no longer threatens their future and the future of their 
children. They want the country’s finances to be managed wisely and 
prudently. 
 
 
We are already sending messages to the European Commission as well as 
other institutions and agencies, both European and international, that are 
closely watching us, that we are determined to reduce the deficit and to keep 
the national debt in check. We seriously want to convince that not only shall 
we be doing our utmost to keep the deficit for this year within the 3 per cent 
threshold but that we mean to work hard so that the ultimate result would be 
even better than what we are forecasting today. 
 
 
Let us be clear – in the current economic and financial situation, both 
internationally and more so in the Eurozone, this is not going to be easy. 
But this situation strengthens our resolve and determination to achieve our 
goals. I assure you this new Government will work in co-ordination and with 
a great deal of energy to repair the damage caused to our finances and it will 
succeed. 
 
 
Our plan is not for one year because were we to do that we would end up 
harming our country’s economy. There is no need for austerity programmes 
and other shocks to redress situations of waste and inefficiency. What we need 
is more flexibility to change bad practices that have become ingrained in our 
11 
 
system and if left unchecked would lead to a deterioration of our financial 
situation. Our pledge for a change in direction demands that we put a stop to 
such practices. 
 
 
For  the  sake  of  transparency,  the  people  have  a  right  to  know  what 
led  to  the  necessity  to  revise  the  Budget  accounts  that  were  presented 
four  months  ago. This revision  results  in  a  larger  estimated  deficit. 
 
 
Let us start with the first reason. From an evaluation of circumstances it results 
that the version of the Budget read out in Parliament by the previous Minister 
last November was not faithfully reflected in the estimates presented that 
same day. The Budget Speech contained pledges for which there was no 
provision in the estimates. 
 
 
In other words, the Nationalist Government had mentioned these pledges in 
the Budget but then did not allocate enough funds for them. They were only 
words. 
 
 
In this regard, I could mention the Youth Organisation Projects, the Out of 
Home Care Programme, the Residential Home for Youth, the Therapeutic 
Facility, the Embark for Life scheme, increases in Stipends, the After Schools 
Programme, Lifelong Learning and others that still need to be identified in 
each Ministry. 
 
 
This was irresponsible. 
 
 
We had to take a decision. What do we do about these programmes the 
Nationalist Government had promised but for which it made no provision?  
The easiest way out would have been to say that since no monies had been 
allocated then these programmes should be scrapped. 
 
 
But that is not how this Government reasons. 
12 
 
We are committed to fulfil all that was pledged and we shall be making 
provision for these programmes in the revised estimates. 
 
 
Since the Budget Speech was read out last November we had a long 
electoral campaign during which a number of Collective Agreements were 
signed, committing the Government to a larger expenditure in the current year. 
These agreements were signed with the teaching staff at MCAST, with 
doctors and nurses. Another agreement was entered into with the University 
redressing the previous cuts in allocations to this institution and because 
of which it could no longer operate. Another agreement was signed with 
pharmacists regarding the Pharmacy of Your Choice scheme. All these pre- 
election agreements necessitate an adjustment in the expenditure estimates. 
 
 
I am not implying that these agreements should not have been entered into. 
On the contrary, most of them should have been signed long ago. 
 
 
I assure all workers that the new Government will be honouring all these 
Collective Agreements.  Because this is a responsible Government. 
 
 
To these must be added expenses in connection with the change of 
administration for which provision is also being made. 
 
 
Therefore the net recurrent expenditure will increase by the net amount of 
€10 million, whilst the net capital expenditure will rise by another €1 million 
over the estimates as presented last November. 
 
 
In the first three months of this year, on the revenue side, Government suffered 
a loss in income from excise duty. This was because the increases announced 
in the Budget of November of last year could not come into force before the 
Budget was approved. This led to a loss of €3 million. 
 
 
Finally, my Ministry had to revise the revenue estimates. The income estimates 
13 
 
for the year 2013 are being revised downwards by a net €57 million which 
include €14 million less in Government contributions for social security. 
 
 
Budgetary Measures 
 
 
Mr Speaker, 
 
 
Some of the Budgetary measures have already come into force. Others are 
yet to be implemented. 
 
 
Save for the measures that will be mentioned later, the Budgetary measures 
that have not yet come into force will do so with effect from 1st January 
2013. 
 
 
These other two measures will be implemented as follows: 
 
 
Firstly, the period during which an option must be taken up as to how 
transfer of property is to be taxed is being extended from seven to twelve 
years. This measure will come into force as of today, 8th April 2013. 
 
 
Secondly, the changes in the rates of Excise Duty according to the various 
schedules will come into force as of tomorrow, 9th April 2013. 
 
 
Tax Exemption on the Minimum Wage 
 
 
As promised, persons whose income tax is computed on the single rate and 
whose only income throughout the year is the minimum wage and the statutory 
bonus, will be tax exempt. This will come about through a specific adjustment 
whereby persons whose income derived solely from employment, including 
the bonus, does not exceed €8,950  during 2013 will not be liable to income 
tax. This will come into effect retrospectively from 1st January 2013. 
14 
 
Exemption from tax on transfer of residential property causa mortis 
 
 
It is evident that on this matter there was confusion and lack of information 
that appears to have been intentional. 
 
 
We distinctly remember the present Prime Minister asking his predecessor 
on live TV to clarify which property was envisaged in this measure. 
 
 
The lack of a reply was indicative that the Nationalist Government wanted 
to give the impression that the transfer of all property would be exempt from 
tax, whereas the provision in the Budget did not tally with this. 
 
 
During the electoral campaign, today’s Opposition maintained that this tax 
would be removed altogether. This was an important test for today’s 
Government. We could have allowed ourselves to be dragged into the 
politics of the auction house and say that we would do the same. 
 
 
Instead, we chose the politics of responsibility and maintained that what the 
others were proposing was not doable. 
 
 
Therefore, today we are presenting this proposal in a way that is realistic and 
which reflects what, in truth, the previous Government had stipulated in its 
workings of last November.  This means that the transfer causa mortis  of 
a residential home of the decujus in favour of the offspring will be exempt 
from transfer tax. This will be backdated to 1st January 2013. 
 
 
Transfer of immovable property in favour of the children. 
 
 
When a person transfers property, for one time only, by way of donation to 
the offspring, which property is intended to be used or developed by the same 
children as their sole residence, there shall be no stamp duty chargeable on 
15 
 
the first €250,000 of the value of the property so transferred.  This measure 
will be backdated to 1st January 2013. 
 
 
Economic Growth Rate 
 
 
Mr Speaker, 
 
 
One of the reasons why the country did not generate a strong enough income 
that would have translated into a tangible improvement in the living standard 
of each family or in the generation of a sizeable quantity of good quality 
full-time employment  was the slow economic growth we have experienced 
since the year 2000. This was partially due to periods during which  the 
external demand for our products and services decreased, as happened during 
the international recession from 2008 to date. There was also a period in 
2004 when we fell in recession caused by austerity programmes resulting 
in high increases in taxes aimed at lowering our deficit and national debt in 
preparation for Malta’s entry into the European Union. 
 
 
However the single highest contributor to the low rate of economic growth 
was that Malta dropped its maximum potential for economic growth from 
the 4 per cent in real terms obtained in the late nineties to the less than 
two per cent that it is today. This means that if the European Union were to 
emerge from this ugly period of lack of economic growth and were to 
increase its demand, Malta would not have the potential to supply this 
increased production to experience an economic growth that exceeds two per 
cent. 
 
 
During this legislature we shall be announcing and implementing a series of 
measures intended to increase the potential for economic growth beyond this 
rate. It is only in this way that we can ensure that our families would start 
feeling a tangible improvement in their standard of living rather than merely 
seeing it as a statistic on paper. 
16 
 
The first of this long list of initiatives will be announced by the Prime Minister 
later on this evening. 
 
 
For the purposes of the Budget exercise the rate of economic growth takes 
on a different role. It becomes that rate on which Government projects its 
revenue from tax on the income of persons and companies, on consumption 
and other economic activities. If Government projects too optimistic a rate 
of growth, as often happened in the past,  this would lead to estimating a 
high level of Government expenditure while at the same time giving the 
impression that   Government would reach the macro-economic and fiscal 
targets with regards to the deficit and public debt. Year after year we have 
seen these targets being missed, primarily because the revenue anticipated 
does not materialise. As a consequence Government was not in a position to 
meet the estimated spending. Three different years have been pointed out as 
the  date in which Malta would balance its budget and in every case this had 
to be postponed to a later date. This date became more and more elusive and 
distant. And as a natural consequence public debt continued to rise. 
 
 
It is therefore imperative that this projected rate of growth be both realistic 
and cautious. In future we need to make sure that the rate of growth projected 
by my Ministry would be consonant with that projected by the European 
Union, by the International Monetary Fund, by the credit rating agencies and 
by the Central Bank. The projected rate of growth for this year is 1.4 per 
cent in real terms and 3.3 per cent in nominal terms. 
 
 
In other words we will not exaggerate in order to impress. We are being 
cautious. Credibility demands this of us. 
 
 
The bad news is that, for the reasons explained earlier, Malta last year has 
once again exceeded the rate of deficit of 3 per cent. 
17 
 
The good news is that we were anticipating this fiscal slippage and we will 
be redressing it during this same year. 
 
 
For this reason, I am announcing that the target for Government deficit for 
this year will be of 2.7 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product. Government’s 
goal, that the deficit be reined in, is in the interest of the country and we 
will make sure that this happens. We intend to see that the rate of deficit is 
reduced by 0.6 per cent each year from this year on. 
 
 
Strategy for Improving Public Finances 
 
 
The new Government is committed to continue controlling the deficit in 
public finances with the aim of keeping it at a sustainable level according to 
the criteria of the European Union and the Eurozone within the framework 
of the fiscal pact. A fiscal framework will be adopted which complements 
the introduction of a new clause in our Constitution regarding a 
balanced budget. Government also aims to reach a balanced budget in the 
realistically shortest time possible. 
 
 
We need to work assiduously to reduce the burden of the national debt and 
the debt accumulated by the various public corporations. Government acts 
as guarantor for  the debt of these public corporations. The interest our 
people are having to pay on the public debt today amounts to €235  million; 
which is equivalent to the deficit in Government’s public finances. This debt 
is a burden on our population and on future generations. 
 
 
Improvement in public finances can only come about if, with a strong will, 
we bravely create an economic environment that is solid enough to give us 
the necessary financial flexibility to do all that is required in this sector. For 
this reason Government policy in this sector is founded on various pillars. 
 
 
We want to make sure that our economy continues to diversify and grow 
18 
 
as much as possible in line with its potential. This should be propelled by 
productive investment and exports not by Government over-spending.  If 
this is brought about it would create wealth and jobs and generate an increase 
in Government revenue whilst at the same time reducing the burdens which 
normally rise when the economy is in slowdown. 
 
 
We want to protect our economy against every sort of financial instability. 
Our country has a strong financial sector, which is very prudent and which 
functions within a very strongly regulated framework that inspires confidence. 
We have a financial sector with very strong capital, ample liquidity and which 
is generating  high profits. We will do everything necessary to enable this 
sector to continue on these lines that are strong, transparent and responsible. 
This is what our country deserves. 
 
 
We want to examine and deeply analyze all our spending to make sure there 
is no unnecessary over-spending, and that we get value and a good return on 
each euro that is spent. 
 
 
We need to make sure that everyone pays their share of taxes, because that is 
what justice demands. Fiscal evasion will not be tolerated because it creates 
an injustice and throws an undeserved burden on those who abide by the law. 
We shall therefore increase our endeavours to instil a stronger culture of 
fiscal morality where every citizen better understands that all taxes due need 
to be paid in the best interests of the whole country. We strongly believe 
that the more Government sends out messages of responsibility and 
prudence in the management of public funds the greater the probability of 
increased fiscal morality. 
 
 
We want to ensure greater financial discipline and fiscal accountability in 
the public sector. Above all we insist that public entities and Local Councils 
guard and control their financial performance. 
19 
 
Moreover, Government will be publishing its reply to the Auditor General’s 
annual report and will be outlining all the measures   it intends to take to 
conform with the Auditor General’s recommendations, together with an 
adequate explanation of any points of divergence. 
 
 
An independent Fiscal Council will be set up with the aim of evaluating the 
Government’s fiscal projections and to guarantee more transparency in the 
budget process and the targets for economic growth. 
 
 
We shall be strengthening and hastening the process of consolidating the 
various functions of Government revenue into one authority in order to 
improve efficiency in tax collection. 
 
 
Fiscal Policy 
 
 
Mr Speaker, 
 
 
Our policy regarding Government taxation is clear. 
 
 
We aim to make sure that the tax burden, that is the amount of tax we collect 
as a proportion of what the country produces, does not increase. On the 
contrary, we want to find ways of reducing this burden within the constraints 
of wisdom, prudence and responsibility, not only to avoid adding new loads 
on families and businesses but also to alleviate as much as possible the 
burdens that exist today. 
 
 
For this reason we need to work courageously to enhance our national wealth 
to the fullest extent possible to ensure adequate Government revenue. A  
revenue capable of maintaining an appropriate level so as to guarantee the 
wide spectrum of public services provided by Government such as health, 
education and social services for our people. An adequate revenue that must 
come from economic growth and the control of fiscal evasion. 
20 
 
At the same time we are promising to spend this revenue in line with our 
priorities, in a way that is strategic, focused, wise and prudent. We shall 
ensure the best value for all we spend so there will be no need for further 
taxation. 
 
 
The fact that we are adopting this ultimate aim as a priority in our fiscal 
policy should give our families and businesses  the necessary peace of mind 
and courage. It should also serve as a good economic incentive. Our families 
should feel assured that their diligence and work will be acknowledged 
and rewarded since we aim to leave a greater proportion of what they earn in 
their pockets. Businesses can invest and feel safe because with us they know 
where they stand. 
 
 
Economic Policy 
 
 
Mr Speaker, 
 
 
Government’s macro-economic policy is clear. 
 
 
We want to strengthen confidence and credibility in our economic and 
financial policy. Confidence and credibility are fostered if we are clear in our 
goals, if we are transparent in the means employed to achieve those goals and 
if we fulfil what we promise. Only in this way can we gain the confidence 
of our people and of the social partners in our country. Only in this way 
can we gain the confidence of the international institutions and the credit 
rating agencies.   Only in this way can we gain the confidence of foreign 
markets and investors. 
 
 
We also need to strive to keep inflation in our country under absolute control. 
Inflation raises prices to the detriment of the consumer and  the productive 
sectors; it erodes the purchasing power and contributes to the decrease of our 
country’s competitiveness in international markets. 
21 
 
For this reason, we must ensure that our markets operate with flexibility 
and transparency. 
 
 
We want to enhance the competitiveness and transparency of our products 
and services markets. For the same objective we must see that our 
regulatory structures are functioning well and effectively to eliminate all 
anti-competitive practices and all other obstacles that could result in higher 
prices. We must also make sure that our public service does not lay 
unjustified burdens on our economy that would then result in increased 
labour costs and higher prices for the consumer. 
 
 
We want to further strengthen consumer protection. With this aim in mind, 
we will see that all our regulatory structures are fulfilling their functions 
efficiently and effectively to serve as a continual shield for the consumer. 
 
 
Our country must work and export to be viable. It must work well, prudently 
and within a framework of high quality in order to compete on the international 
markets. In this regard I must take this opportunity to emphasise the need 
for continual improvement in our country’s productivity. We all have to 
work hard to be able to supply quality products and services at the lowest 
possible prices. Therefore I must emphasise the need of extreme care to avoid 
unjustified increases in the cost of production. Similarly, we need to invest 
in the quality of the products and services we offer. 
 
 
We are not alone on the international markets. Competition has grown and 
has become very fierce. We depend on these markets for our work and 
livelihood. We must therefore be vigilant against anything that might threaten 
our country’s competitiveness. 
 
 
Government will do its utmost to create and maintain the best possible 
environment in which our economy could grow in a sustainable manner. 
22 
 
We shall strive to create a climate of peace of mind in which, through 
judiciousness and transparency, our economic operators will know where 
they stand. We shall see to it that pointless bureaucracy does not create extra 
costs that weigh down our enterprises and hamper economic growth. 
 
 
We will be announcing measures intended to stimulate the economy towards 
economic growth that is closer to its potential. We want to see more 
investment in infrastructure and the productive capabilities of the country, in 
the skills of our workforce and more workers, both male and female, entering 
the labour market. 
 
 
In this  context Government  will  do  everything necessary  to  promote a 
diversified and balanced economy. 
 
 
The manufacturing sector is here to stay and it must be further strengthened 
even through channelling it towards the production of high value added 
goods. Whilst tourism already contributes substantially towards our 
economy, even in this sector we must open up new markets and seek new 
niche markets as well as strive to increase our competitiveness. 
 
 
In the financial sector we will continue to insist on rigorous practices and 
stability through a policy of measured growth in the sector. Here, the emphasis 
will remain on quality rather than quantity. The same applies to i-gaming, a 
sector which we want to see expanding in a sustainable manner. 
 
 
The creative economy, which incorporates the sectors of IT, digital gaming 
and the film industry among others, will be further incentivized because we 
believe this could grow into an important pillar that sustains our economy. 
We also believe that there is room for more investment and the creation of 
quality jobs if we sensibly develop the Green Economy. 
 
 
The maritime and aviation sectors are also economic sectors capable of further 
23 
 
development, contributing towards the diversification of our economy 
and the creation of more quality jobs. 
 
 
Strategy for Job Creation 
 
 
Mr Speaker, 
 
 
As I have already stated, economic growth, the safeguarding and the creation 
of jobs are absolute priorities in this Government’s economic strategy. 
These targets will be reached through a labour policy that rests on two 
pillars. 
 
 
Firstly, an economic policy that is clear and effective, calculated to create 
work opportunities in diversified and sustainable sectors. 
 
 
Secondly, a labour market policy which has as its focal point the individual 
and his/her need for adequate quality work capable of satisfying his/her 
legitimate aspirations and those of their families. 
 
 
We are aiming for the consolidation and expansion of our economic sectors as 
well as economic diversification. All this comes about through the creation 
of a stable and transparent economic climate, a package of incentives that 
facilitate entrepreneurship and investment as well as investment in both 
established and new productive spheres. 
 
 
All this, together with the investment Government intends to make in the 
fields of education and training, in health and social welfare to ensure that 
no one is emarginated or left to lag behind, should continue to encourage 
and stimulate local and foreign investment in our economy for the creation 
of jobs for all who wish to enter the labour market. Well-paid and quality 
work.  Work that is not precarious and that affords dignity and satisfaction 
to whoever performs it. 
24 
 
With this aim in mind, we want to ensure that our workers are well prepared 
to enter the labour market. We want to ensure and emphasise lifelong 
training. We must see that all those who lose their jobs find the necessary 
help and means to reintegrate themselves in the workforce. We want to see 
more women retaining their jobs or re-entering the workforce once they 
have fulfilled the needs of their families. 
 
 
The Public Service 
 
 
The Public Service is the backbone and the motor which on a daily basis 
must drive and spur the country forward through the implementation of 
Government strategies and policies. The Public Service is there to facilitate 
governance, to serve and help the people in fulfilling and achieving their 
aspirations for a better life. Consequently, Government cannot but give 
utmost importance to the Public Service and its operations. 
 
 
We cannot achieve what we desire for our country and our people if we do 
not have a Public Service that functions properly. We cannot reach our targets 
if our public service is not vigilant and constantly aware of the economic and 
social developments taking place both locally and abroad. For this reason we 
insist on a dynamic public sector, a public sector that is judicious, attentive 
and which responds quickly and efficiently to current and future challenges. 
We shall insist on the need to have an efficient and effective public service 
that gives value for money. Therefore, Government departments and entities 
must: 
 
 
– understand that they are there to serve the public and the business 
community in our country; 
 
 
–  be aware that they are there to help the country to function better and more 
effectively; 
25 
 
–  have a clearer picture of their raison d’être and what they should pay back 
to the country which invests in them; 
 
 
–  propose expenditure leading to clear and positive results for the public and 
the business community; 
 
 
–  give more importance to the country’s need to get value for money through 
their operations. 
 
 
Above all, we shall insist on the need of a public administration that is 
efficient, transparent and which responds to the needs of the people and the 
country rapidly and promptly. We want to be very clear about this. There is 
no place for a heavy bureaucracy and undue delays in a modern economy 
that must compete in international markets. 
 
 
We shall therefore see to it that administrative procedures are simplified. 
We shall seek to lighten up the bureaucratic procedures currently in place. 
We shall look into our commercial legislation with a view to eliminating 
those parts that are no longer necessary and merely hamper enterprise. 
We shall seek to apply the principle of “one in, one out”  with reference to 
new commercial legislation  so that for each new law that comes into force 
another   obsolete one is abrogated. We shall introduce the concept of the 
“sunset clause” so that certain laws seize to apply after a certain date, unless 
otherwise specified. 
 
 
This will avert unnecessary bureaucracy and the added costs it entails. We 
shall seek to introduce the concept of one licence granted within a specified 
time by a single authority for the start-up of a business in our country. 
We shall do all this and more to lighten the burden, to remove all obstacles 
currently faced by businesses in our country and to reduce the cost of 
production as much as possible. 
26 
 
Conclusion 
 
 
Mr Speaker, 
 
 
For reasons known to all, the Budget for this year is being moved for the 
approval of the House by the new Government although it did not conceive 
it. The nature of this Budget is likely to disappoint many who expected new 
measures. But everyone must understand that the sole aim of this Budget is 
to take stock of the financial situation of the country, to update it and to 
approve in the shortest possible time those measures promised last year and 
which should have come into force at the beginning of the current year. But 
as we say – better late than never. 
 
 
A new Budget will be presented by this new Government next November. 
coming and work on it started on our very first day in office. 
 
 
However, this extraordinary Budget is at the same time giving us the 
opportunity to look into a number of principles relating to the improvement 
in public finances which are the norm in today’s modern world and which the 
new Government will not only embrace but also implement. A Budget that is 
giving us the opportunity to send the right messages to the people so early in 
the life of this Parliament. 
 
 
Firstly, we want to send out the message of stability. Economic and financial 
stability that is the foundation on which we will build the future of our 
country. An attractive future that should stir the aspirations of our families 
for a better life. 
 
 
Secondly, we want to pass on a message of hope and courage to our people. 
All of us, together, one Government after another, we have all given our input 
in building a successful country. A small country that we have transformed 
27 
 
from a colony into a proud nation. A small country which through our efforts 
no longer depends on a foreign military base for its survival and for which we 
have built a solid and diversified economy. A small country that has enhanced 
the living standards of its people through the wisdom of its leaders and the 
extensive and determined effort of the whole population. 
 
 
Together we built a successful country  that is a success. Together we shall 
continue to work and build this country. Together, with courage and 
confidence, we shall continue to look ahead. We shall continue in our efforts 
to overcome the challenges that confront us and to create work. Together we 
shall continue to create a country that is caring and inclusive and where no 
one feels left out. 
 
 
Together we shall continue our endeavours to turn Malta into a country 
that is more modern, more beautiful and much stronger. A Malta for us all.
